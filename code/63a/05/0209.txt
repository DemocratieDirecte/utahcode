63A-5-209.   Building appropriations supervised by director -- Disposition
of surplus.
(1)  The director shall:
(a)  supervise the expenditure of funds in providing plans, engineering
specifications, sites, and construction of the buildings for which legislative
appropriations are made and shall specifically allocate money appropriated
when more than one project is included in any single appropriation without
legislative directive;
(b) (i)  expend the amount necessary from appropriations for planning,
engineering, and architectural work; and
(ii)  allocate amounts from appropriations necessary to cover expenditures
previously made from the planning fund in the preparation of plans,
engineering, and specifications shall be returned to the fund; and
(c)  hold in a statewide contingency reserve the amount budgeted for
contingencies in appropriations for the construction or remodeling of
facilities, for contingencies which may be over and above all amounts
obligated by contract for planning, engineering, and architectural work,
sites, and construction contracts.
(i)  The amount budgeted for contingencies shall be based on a sliding scale
percentage of the construction cost.  The sliding scale shall range from
4-1/2% to 6-1/2% for new construction, and from 6% to 9-1/2% for remodeling
projects.
(ii)  The statewide contingency funds shall be held by the director to cover
costs such as change orders and other unforeseen, necessary costs beyond those
specifically budgeted for the project.
(iii) (A)  The Legislature shall annually review the percentage and the amount
held in the statewide contingency reserve.
(B)  The Legislature may reappropriate to other building needs, including the
cost of administering building projects, any amount from the statewide
contingency reserve that is determined to be in excess of the reserve required
to meet future contingency needs.
(2)  The director shall hold in a separate reserve those state appropriated
funds accrued through bid savings and project residual as a project reserve.
(a)  The director may authorize the use of project reserve funds only for the
award of contracts in excess of the construction budget if this is required to
meet the intent of the project.
(b)  The Legislature shall annually review the amount held in the project
reserve for possible reallocation by the Legislature to other building needs,
including the cost of administering building projects.
(3) If any part of the appropriation for a building project, other than the
part set aside for the Utah Percent-for-Art Program under Title 9, Chapter 6,
Part 4, remains unencumbered after the award of construction and professional
service contracts, and establishing a reserve for fixed and moveable
equipment, the balance of the appropriation shall be dedicated to the project
reserve and does not revert to the General Fund.
(4) (a)  One percent of the amount appropriated for the construction of any
new state building or facility may be appropriated and set aside for the Utah
Percent-for-Art Program administered by the Division of Fine Arts under Title
9, Chapter 6, Part 4.
(b)  The director shall release to the Division of Fine Arts any funds
included in an appropriation to the division that are designated by the
Legislature for the Utah Percent-for-Art Program.
(c)  Funds from appropriations for any state building or facility of which any
part is derived from the issuance of bonds, to the extent it would jeopardize
the federal income tax exemption otherwise allowed for interest paid on bonds,
may not be set aside.
