36-2-5.   Duties of Legislative Compensation Commission.
The Legislative Compensation Commission has the following duties:
(1) It shall study and formulate recommendations concerning the salary levels
for Utah state legislators. The study should be based upon maintaining a
citizen Legislature in Utah, but compensating members fairly for their service
in order that all individuals would have an opportunity to serve. Comparisons
with salaries of other similar state legislators and other such factors should
be considered in developing the recommendations.  This study does not include
a review of the appropriate expense level of legislators.
(2) The commission shall submit to each member of the Legislature, by January
2nd of each even-numbered year, recommendations concerning changes, if any,
which should be made in the salary plan and its administration for state
legislators.  This recommendation shall include a recitation of the provisions
of Section 36-2-3.
