(B)  each "Seasonal A" agency shall be paired with a "Seasonal B" agency.

(d) (i)  If the location, design, and construction of a hotel may require more than one package agency sales location to serve the public convenience, the commission may authorize a single package agent to sell liquor at as many as three locations within the hotel under one package agency if:

(A)  the hotel has a minimum of 150 guest rooms; and

(B)  all locations under the agency are:

(i)  within 600 feet of a community location, as measured by the method described in Subsection (3)(e); or

(ii)  within 200 feet of a community location, measured in a straight line from the nearest entrance of the proposed package agency to the nearest property boundary of the community location.

(b)  With respect to the establishment of a package agency, the commission may authorize a variance to reduce the proximity requirement of Subsection (3)(a)(i) if:

(II)  there is no reasonably viable alternative for satisfying substantial unmet demand described in Subsection (3)(b)(v)(B)(I) other than through the establishment of a package agency; and

(III)  there is no reasonably viable alternative location within the geographic boundary of the local authority in which the package agency is to be located for establishing a package agency to satisfy the unmet demand described in Subsection (3)(b)(v)(B)(I).

(c)  With respect to the establishment of a package agency, the commission may authorize a variance that reduces the proximity requirement of Subsection (3)(a)(ii) if:

(v)  after giving full consideration to all of the attending circumstances and the policies stated in Subsections 32A-1-104(3) and (4), the commission determines that establishing the package agency would not be detrimental to the public health, peace, safety, and welfare of the community; and

(vi) (A)  the community location governing authority gives its written consent to the variance; or

(III)  there is no reasonably viable alternative location within the geographic boundary of the local authority in which the package agency is to be located for establishing a package agency to satisfy the unmet demand described in Subsection (3)(c)(vi)(B)(I).

(d)  With respect to the premises of a package agency issued by the commission that undergoes a change of ownership, the commission may waive or vary the proximity requirements of Subsection (3)(a) in considering whether to grant a package agency to the new owner of the premises if:
