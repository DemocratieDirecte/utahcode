(1) (a)  The commission may grant to a person a resort license for the purpose of allowing the storage, sale, service, and consumption of an alcoholic beverage in connection with a resort designated in the resort license if the person operates at least four sublicenses under the resort license.

(b)  A resort license shall:

(i)  consist of:

(A)  a general resort license; and

(B)  the four or more sublicenses; and

(ii)  designate the boundary of the resort building.

(c)  This chapter does not prohibit an alcoholic beverage on the boundary of the resort building to the extent otherwise permitted by this title.

(d)  The commission may not grant a sublicense that is separate from a resort license.

(2) (a)  The total number of resort licenses may not at any time aggregate more than four.

(b)  The commission may not include a sublicense in determining whether or not the total number of licenses granted under the provisions applicable to the sublicense aggregate more than a number calculated by dividing the population of the state by the number specified in the provisions applicable to the sublicense.

(c)  Notwithstanding Subsection (2)(b), the commission may not grant to a person a license under the provisions applicable to a sublicense that on May 11, 2009, was not available because the sublicense was included in determining if the total number of licenses granted under the provisions applicable to the sublicense aggregate more than the number calculated by dividing the population of the state by the number specified in the provisions applicable to the sublicense.

(d)  By no later than the November 2009 interim meeting of the Business and Labor Interim Committee, the department shall:

(i)  report to the Business and Labor Interim Committee the number and types of sublicenses under a resort license granted by the commission as of September 30, 2009; and

(ii)  recommend legislation to adjust the numbers in the provisions applicable to sublicenses to reflect the number of sublicenses that because of the issuance of a resort license are not included in determining whether or not the total number of licenses granted under the provisions applicable to a sublicense aggregate more than a number calculated by dividing the population of the state by the number specified in the provisions applicable to the sublicense.

(3) (a)  Except as provided in Subsection (3)(b), (c), or (d), a resort building may not be granted if the resort building is:

(i)  within 600 feet of a community location, as measured by the method in Subsection (3)(e); or

(ii)  within 200 feet of a community location, measured in a straight line from the nearest entrance of the proposed outlet to the nearest property boundary of the community location.

(b)  With respect to the establishment of a resort license, the commission may authorize a variance to reduce the proximity requirement of Subsection (3)(a)(i) if:

(i)  the local authority grants its written consent to the variance;

(ii)  the commission finds that alternative locations for establishing a resort license in the community are limited;

(iii)  the variance is authorized after a public hearing is held in the city, town, or county, and where practical in the neighborhood concerned;

(iv)  after giving full consideration to all of the attending circumstances and the policies stated in Subsections 32A-1-104(3) and (4), the commission determines that establishing the resort license would not be detrimental to the public health, peace, safety, and welfare of the community; and

(v) (A)  the community location governing authority gives its written consent to the variance; or

(B)  when written consent is not given by the community location governing authority, the commission finds that the applicant has established that:

(I)  there is substantial unmet public demand to consume alcohol in a public setting within the geographic boundary of the local authority in which the resort building is to be located;

(II)  there is no reasonably viable alternative for satisfying substantial unmet demand described in Subsection (3)(b)(v)(B)(I) other than through the establishment of a resort license; and

(III)  there is no reasonably viable alternative location within the geographic boundary of the local authority in which the resort building is to be located for establishing a resort license to satisfy the unmet demand described in Subsection (3)(b)(v)(B)(I).

(c)  With respect to the establishment of a resort license, the commission may authorize a variance that reduces the proximity requirement of Subsection (3)(a)(ii) if:

(i)  the community location at issue is:

(A)  a public library; or

(B)  a public park;

(ii)  the local authority grants its written consent to the variance;

(iii)  the commission finds that alternative locations for establishing a resort license in the community are limited;

(iv)  a public hearing is held in the city, town, or county, and where practical in the neighborhood concerned;

(v)  after giving full consideration to all of the attending circumstances and the policies stated in Subsections 32A-1-104(3) and (4), the commission determines that establishing the resort license would not be detrimental to the public health, peace, safety, and welfare of the community; and

(vi) (A)  the community location governing authority gives its written consent to the variance; or

(B)  when written consent is not given by the community location governing authority, the commission finds that the applicant has established that:

(I)  there is substantial unmet public demand to consume alcohol in a public setting within the geographic boundary of the local authority in which the resort building is to be located;

(II)  there is no reasonably viable alternative for satisfying substantial unmet demand described in Subsection (3)(c)(vi)(B)(I) other than through the establishment of a resort license; and

(III)  there is no reasonably viable alternative location within the geographic boundary of the local authority in which the resort building is to be located for establishing a resort license to satisfy the unmet demand described in Subsection (3)(c)(vi)(B)(I).

(d)  With respect to a resort building of a resort license granted by the commission that undergoes a change of ownership, the commission may waive or vary the proximity requirements of Subsection (3)(a) in considering whether to grant a resort license to the new owner of the resort license if the resort license previously received a variance reducing the proximity requirement of Subsection (3)(a)(i).

(e)  The 600 foot limitation described in Subsection (3)(a)(i) is measured from the nearest entrance of the outlet by following the shortest route of ordinary pedestrian travel to the property boundary of the community location.
