(b)  For a class of business, the premium rates charged during a rating period to covered insureds with similar case characteristics for the same or similar coverage, or the rates that could be charged to an employer group under the rating system for that class of business, may not vary from the index rate by more than 30% of the index rate, except when catastrophic mental health coverage is selected as provided in Subsection 31A-22-625(2)(d).

(3)  The percentage increase in the premium rate charged to a covered insured for a new rating period, adjusted pro rata for rating periods less than a year, may not exceed the sum of the following:

(D)  a family, consisting of an employee plus spouse, and a dependent or dependents.

(7)  If a health benefit plan is a health benefit plan into which the small employer carrier is no longer enrolling new covered insureds, the small employer carrier shall use the percentage change in the base premium rate, provided that the change does not exceed, on a percentage basis, the change in the new business premium rate for the most similar health benefit product into which the small employer carrier is actively enrolling new covered insureds.

(8) (a)  A covered carrier may not transfer a covered insured involuntarily into or out of a class of business.
