31A-22-411.   Contracts providing variable benefits.
(1) (a)  Any contract which provides for payment of benefits in variable
amounts shall contain a statement of the essential features of the procedure
to be followed by the insurer in determining the dollar amount of the variable
benefits.  The contract shall contain:
(i)  appropriate nonforfeiture benefits in lieu of those required by either
Section 31A-22-408 or 31A-22-409;
(ii)  appropriate reinstatement provisions in lieu of those required by
Section 31A-22-407; and
(iii)  grace period provisions appropriate to that type of contract in lieu of
those required by Section 31A-22-402.
(b)  This individual contract and any certificate issued under a group
contract shall state that the dollar amount may decrease or increase and shall
conspicuously display on its first page a statement that the benefits under
the contract are payable on a variable basis, with a statement specifying
where the details of the variable provisions are found in the contract.
(c)  Life insurance and annuity policies with variable benefits issued under a
separate account shall, on either the application or the policy, state that
the insurer's liabilities with respect to variable benefits under the policy
are subject to satisfaction only out of the insurer's variable account assets.
(2)  Any contract subject to Subsection (1) shall state whether it may be
amended as to investment policy, voting rights, and conduct of the business
and affairs of any segregated account.  Subject to any preemptive provision of
federal law, this type of amendment is subject to filing under Section
31A-21-201 and approval by a majority of the policyholders in the segregated
account.
