(b) (i)  "Underinsured motor vehicle" includes a motor vehicle, the operation,
maintenance, or use of which is covered under a liability policy at the time
of an injury-causing occurrence, but which has insufficient liability coverage
to compensate fully the injured party for all special and general damages.
(ii)  The term "underinsured motor vehicle" does not include:
(A)  a motor vehicle that is covered under the liability coverage of the same
policy that also contains the underinsured motorist coverage;
(B)  an uninsured motor vehicle as defined in Subsection 31A-22-305(2); or
(C)  a motor vehicle owned or leased by:
(I)  the named insured;
(II)  the named insured's spouse; or
(III)  any dependent of the named insured.
(2) (a) (i)  Underinsured motorist coverage under Subsection 31A-22-302(1)(c)
provides coverage for covered persons who are legally entitled to recover
damages from owners or operators of underinsured motor vehicles because of
bodily injury, sickness, disease, or death.
(ii)  A covered person occupying or using a motor vehicle owned, leased, or
furnished to the covered person, the covered person's spouse, or covered
person's resident relative may recover underinsured benefits only if the motor
vehicle is:
(A)  described in the policy under which a claim is made; or
(B)  a newly acquired or replacement motor vehicle covered under the terms of
the policy.
(b)  For new policies written on or after January 1, 2001, the limits of
underinsured motorist coverage shall be equal to the lesser of the limits of
the insured's motor vehicle liability coverage or the maximum underinsured
motorist coverage limits available by the insurer under the insured's motor
vehicle policy, unless the insured purchases coverage in a lesser amount by
signing an acknowledgment form that:
(i)  is filed with the department;
(ii)  is provided by the insurer;
(iii)  waives the higher coverage;
(iv)  reasonably explains the purpose of underinsured motorist coverage; and
(v)  discloses the additional premiums required to purchase underinsured
motorist coverage with limits equal to the lesser of the limits of the
insured's motor vehicle liability coverage or the maximum underinsured
motorist coverage limits available by the insurer under the insured's motor
vehicle policy.
(c)  A self-insured, including a governmental entity, may elect to provide
underinsured motorist coverage in an amount that is less than its maximum
self-insured retention under Subsections (2)(b) and (2)(g) by issuing a
declaratory memorandum or policy statement from the chief financial officer or
chief risk officer that declares the:
(i)  self-insured entity's coverage level; and
(ii)  process for filing an underinsured motorist claim.
(d)  Underinsured motorist coverage may not be sold with limits that are less
than:
(i)  $10,000 for one person in any one accident; and

(e)  The acknowledgment under Subsection (2)(b) continues for that issuer of
the underinsured motorist coverage until the insured, in writing, requests
different underinsured motorist coverage from the insurer.
(f) (i)  The named insured's underinsured motorist coverage, as described in
Subsection (2)(a), is secondary to the liability coverage of an owner or
operator of an underinsured motor vehicle, as described in Subsection (1).
(ii)  Underinsured motorist coverage may not be set off against the liability
coverage of the owner or operator of an underinsured motor vehicle, but shall
be added to, combined with, or stacked upon the liability coverage of the
owner or operator of the underinsured motor vehicle to determine the limit of
coverage available to the injured person.
(g) (i)  A named insured may reject underinsured motorist coverage by an
express writing to the insurer that provides liability coverage under
Subsection 31A-22-302(1)(a).
(ii)  This written rejection shall be on a form provided by the insurer that
includes a reasonable explanation of the purpose of underinsured motorist
coverage and when it would be applicable.
(iii)  This rejection continues for that issuer of the liability coverage
until the insured in writing requests underinsured motorist coverage from that
liability insurer.
(h) (i)  In conjunction with the first two renewal notices sent after January
1, 2001, for policies existing on that date, the insurer shall disclose in the
same medium as the premium renewal notice, an explanation of:

(B)  the costs associated with increasing the coverage in amounts up to and
including the maximum amount available by the insurer under the insured's
motor vehicle policy.
(ii)  The disclosure required by this Subsection (2)(h) shall be sent to all
insureds that carry underinsured motorist coverage limits in an amount less
than the insured's motor vehicle liability policy limits or the maximum
underinsured motorist coverage limits available by the insurer under the
insured's motor vehicle policy.
(3) (a) (i)  Except as provided in this Subsection (3), a covered person
injured in a motor vehicle described in a policy that includes underinsured
motorist benefits may not elect to collect underinsured motorist coverage
benefits from any other motor vehicle insurance policy.
(ii)  The limit of liability for underinsured motorist coverage for two or
more motor vehicles may not be added together, combined, or stacked to
determine the limit of insurance coverage available to an injured person for
any one accident.
(iii)  Subsection (3)(a)(ii) applies to all persons except a covered person
described under Subsections (3)(b)(i) and (ii).
(b) (i)  Except as provided in Subsection (3)(b)(ii), a covered person injured
while occupying, using, or maintaining a motor vehicle that is not owned,
leased, or furnished to the covered person, the covered person's spouse, or
the covered person's resident parent or resident sibling, may also recover
benefits under any one other policy under which they are a covered person.
(ii) (A)  A covered person may recover benefits from no more than two
additional policies, one additional policy from each parent's household if the
covered person is:
(I)  a dependent minor of parents who reside in separate households; and

leased, or furnished to the covered person, the covered person's resident
parent, or the covered person's resident sibling.

the percentage of the damages that the limit of liability of each parent's
policy of underinsured motorist coverage bears to the total of both parents'
underinsured coverage applicable to the accident.
(iii)  A covered person's recovery under any available policies may not exceed
the full amount of damages.
(iv)  Underinsured coverage on a motor vehicle occupied at the time of an
accident shall be primary coverage, and the coverage elected by a person
described under Subsections 31A-22-305(1)(a) and (b) shall be secondary
coverage.
(v)  The primary and the secondary coverage may not be set off against the
other.

the highest limits of underinsured motorist coverage under only one additional
policy per household applicable to that covered person as a named insured,
spouse, or relative.

elections if recovery is unavailable under previous elections.

person liable for the injuries caused in the accident; or
(ii)  pay the insured an amount equal to the policy limits tendered by the
liability carrier.
