(d)  A grace period is not required if the policyholder has requested that the policy be discontinued.

(2)  Every group or blanket accident and health policy shall provide for a grace period of at least 30 days, unless the policyholder gives written notice of discontinuance prior to the date of discontinuance, in accordance with the policy terms.  In group or blanket policies, the policy may provide for payment of a pro rata premium for the period the policy is in effect during the grace period under this Subsection (2).
