31A-22-614.6.   Health care delivery and payment reform demonstration
projects.
(1)  The Legislature finds that:
(a)  current health care delivery and payment systems do not provide
systemwide aligned incentives for the appropriate delivery of health care;
(b)  some health care providers and health care payers have developed ideas
for health care delivery and payment system reform, but lack the critical
number of patient lives and payer involvement to accomplish systemwide reform;
and
(c)  there is a compelling state interest to encourage as many health care
providers and health care payers to join together and coordinate efforts at
systemwide health care delivery and payment reform.
(2) (a)  The Office of Consumer Health Services within the Governor's Office
of Economic Development shall convene meetings of health care providers and
health care payers through a neutral, non-biased entity that can demonstrate
it has the support of a broad base of the participants in this process for the
purpose of coordinating broad based demonstration projects for health care
delivery and payment reform.
(b) (i)  The speaker of the House of Representatives may appoint a person who
is a member of the House of Representatives, or from the Office of Legislative
Research and General Counsel, to attend the meetings convened under Subsection
(2)(a).
(ii)  The president of the Senate may appoint a person who is a senator, or
from the Office of Legislative Research and General Counsel, to attend the
meetings convened under Subsection (2)(a).
(c)  Participation in the coordination efforts by health care providers and
health care payers is voluntary, but is encouraged.
(3)  The commissioner and the Office of Consumer Health Services shall
facilitate coordinated broad based demonstration projects for health care
delivery and payment reform between various health care providers and health
care payers who elect to participate in the demonstration projects by:
(a)  consulting with health care providers and health care payers who elect to
join together in a broad based reform demonstration project; and
(b)  adopting administrative rules in accordance with Title 63G, Chapter 3,
Utah Administrative Rulemaking Act, as necessary to implement the
demonstration project.
(4)  The Office of Consumer Health Services and the commissioner shall report
to the Health Reform Task Force by October 2009, and to the Legislature's
Business and Labor Interim Committee every October thereafter regarding the
progress towards coordination of broad based health care system payment and
delivery reform.
