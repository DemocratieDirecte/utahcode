31A-20-106.   Variable contracts.
No insurer may deliver within this state any contract providing life or
annuity benefits in variable amounts until the insurer has satisfied the
commissioner that its condition and methods of operation in connection with
those types of contracts do not render its operation hazardous to the public
or its policyholders in Utah.  In determining the qualification of an insurer
requesting authority to deliver those contracts in Utah, the commissioner
shall consider:
(1)  the history and financial condition of the insurer;
(2)  the character, responsibility, and general fitness of the insurer's
officers and directors; and
(3)  in the case of a foreign insurer, whether the regulation provided by the
state of its domicile or the jurisdiction in which its head office is located
provides protection to policyholders and the public substantially equal to
that provided by the Insurance Code and the rules issued under it.
