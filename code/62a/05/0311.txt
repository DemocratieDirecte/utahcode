(1)  The director of the division or his designee may temporarily commit an
individual to the division and therefore, as a matter of course, to a mental
retardation facility for observation and evaluation upon:
(a)  written application by a responsible person who has reason to know that
the individual is in need of commitment, stating:
(i)  a belief that the individual has mental retardation and is likely to
cause serious injury to self or others if not immediately committed;
(ii)  personal knowledge of the individual's condition; and
(iii)  the circumstances supporting that belief; or
(b)  certification by a licensed physician or designated mental retardation
professional stating that the physician or designated mental retardation
professional:
(i)  has examined the individual within a three-day period immediately
preceding the certification; and
(ii)  is of the opinion that the individual has mental retardation, and that
because of the individual's mental retardation is likely to injure self or
others if not immediately committed.
(2)  If the individual in need of commitment is not placed in the custody of
the director or his designee by the person submitting the application, the
director or his designee may certify, either in writing or orally that the
individual is in need of immediate commitment to prevent injury to self or
others.
(3)  Upon receipt of the application required by Subsection (1)(a) and the
certifications required by Subsection (1)(b) and Subsection (2), a peace
officer may take the individual named in the application and certificates into
custody, and may transport the individual to a designated mental retardation
facility.
(4) (a)  An individual committed under this section may be held for a maximum
of 24 hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays.  At the
expiration of that time, the individual shall be released unless proceedings
for involuntary commitment have been commenced under Section 62A-5-312.
(b)  After proceedings for involuntary commitment have been commenced the
individual shall be released unless an order of detention is issued in
accordance with Section 62A-5-312.
(5)  If an individual is committed to the division under this section on the
application of any person other than the individual's legal guardian, spouse,
parent, or next of kin, the director or his designee shall immediately give
notice of the commitment to the individual's legal guardian, spouse, parent,
or next of kin, if known.
