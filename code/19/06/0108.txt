facility or site -- Administrative and legislative approval required --
Exemptions from legislative and gubernatorial approval -- Time periods for
review -- Information required -- Other conditions -- Revocation of approval
-- Periodic review.
(1)  For purposes of this section, the following items shall be treated as
submission of a new operation plan:
(a)  the submission of a revised operation plan specifying a different
geographic site than a previously submitted plan;
(b)  an application for modification of a commercial hazardous waste
incinerator if the construction or the modification would increase the
hazardous waste incinerator capacity above the capacity specified in the
operation plan as of January 1, 1990, or the capacity specified in the
operation plan application as of January 1, 1990, if no operation plan
approval has been issued as of January 1, 1990;
(c)  an application for modification of a commercial nonhazardous solid waste
incinerator if the construction of the modification would cost 50% or more of
the cost of construction of the original incinerator or the modification would
result in an increase in the capacity or throughput of the incinerator of a
cumulative total of 50% above the total capacity or throughput that was
approved in the operation plan as of January 1, 1990, or the initial approved
operation plan if the initial approval is subsequent to January 1, 1990; or
(d)  an application for modification of a commercial nonhazardous solid or
hazardous waste treatment, storage, or disposal facility, other than an
incinerator, if the modification would be outside the boundaries of the
property owned or controlled by the applicant, as shown in the application or
approved operation plan as of January 1, 1990, or the initial approved
operation plan if the initial approval is subsequent to January 1, 1990.
(2)  Capacity under Subsection (1)(b) shall be calculated based on the
throughput tonnage specified for the trial burn in the operation plan or the
operation plan application if no operation plan approval has been issued as of
January 1, 1990, and on annual operations of 7,000 hours.
(3) (a) (i)  No person may own, construct, modify, or operate any facility or
site for the purpose of disposing of nonhazardous solid waste or treating,
storing, or disposing of hazardous waste without first submitting and
receiving the approval of the executive secretary for an operation plan for
that facility or site.
