38-1-22.   Advance payments under terms of contract -- Effect on liens.
The subcontractors' liens provided for in this chapter shall extend to the
full contract price, but if at the time of the commencement to do work or
furnish materials the owner has paid upon the contract, in accordance with the
terms thereof, any portion of the contract price, either in money or property,
the lien of the contractor shall extend only to such unpaid balance, and the
lien of any subcontractor who has notice of such payment shall be limited to
the unpaid balance of the contract price. No part of the contract price shall
by the terms of any contract be made payable, nor shall the same or any part
thereof be paid in advance of the commencement of the work, for the purpose of
evading or defeating the provisions of this chapter.
