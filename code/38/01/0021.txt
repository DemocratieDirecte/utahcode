No payment made prior to the time when the same is due under the terms and
conditions of the contract shall be valid for the purpose of defeating,
diminishing or discharging any lien in favor of any person except the
contractor; but as to any such lien such payment shall be deemed as if not
made, notwithstanding that the contractor to whom it was paid may thereafter
abandon his contract or be or become indebted to the owner for damages for
nonperformance of his contract or otherwise.
