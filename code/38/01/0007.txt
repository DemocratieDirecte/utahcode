(1) (a) (i)  Except as modified in Section 38-1-27, a person claiming benefits
under this chapter shall file for record with the county recorder of the
county in which the property, or some part of the property, is situated, a
written notice to hold and claim a lien no later than:
(A)  180 days after the day on which occurs final completion of the original

contract, and for purposes of Section 38-1-33, final completion of the
project, means:
(A)  if as a result of work performed under the original contract a permanent
certificate of occupancy is required for the work, the date of issuance of a
permanent certificate of occupancy by the local government entity having
jurisdiction over the construction project;
(B)  if no certificate of occupancy is required by the local government entity
having jurisdiction over the construction project, but as a result of the work
performed under the original contract an inspection is required as per state-
adopted building codes for the work, the date of the final inspection for the
work by the local government entity having jurisdiction over the construction
project;

on which substantial work was performed under the original contract.
(b)  Notwithstanding Section 38-1-2, where a subcontractor performs
substantial work after the applicable dates established by Subsections
(1)(a)(ii)(A) and (B), that subcontractor's subcontract shall be considered an
original contract for the sole purpose of determining:
(i)  the subcontractor's time frame to file a notice of intent to hold and
claim a lien under this Subsection (1); and
(ii)  the original contractor's time frame to file a notice of intent to hold
and claim a lien under this Subsection (1) for that subcontractor's work.
(c)  For purposes of this chapter, the term "substantial work" does not
include:
(i)  repair work; or
(ii)  warranty work.
(d)  Notwithstanding Subsection (1)(a)(ii)(C), final completion of the
original contract does not occur if work remains to be completed for which the
owner is holding payment to ensure completion of that work.
(2) (a)  The notice required by Subsection (1) shall contain a statement
setting forth:
(i)  the name of the reputed owner if known or, if not known, the name of the

38-11-102, a statement describing what steps an owner, as defined in Section
38-11-102, may take to require a lien claimant to remove the lien in
accordance with Section 38-11-107.
(b)  Substantial compliance with the requirements of this chapter is
sufficient to hold and claim a lien.
(3) (a)  Within 30 days after filing the notice of lien, the lien claimant
shall deliver or mail by certified mail a copy of the notice of lien to:
(i)  the reputed owner of the real property; or
(ii)  the record owner of the real property.
(b)  If the record owner's current address is not readily available to the
lien claimant, the copy of the claim may be mailed to the last-known address
of the record owner, using the names and addresses appearing on the last
completed real property assessment rolls of the county where the affected
property is located.
(c)  Failure to deliver or mail the notice of lien to the reputed owner or
record owner precludes the lien claimant from an award of costs and attorneys'
fees against the reputed owner or record owner in an action to enforce the
lien.
(4)  The Division of Occupational and Professional Licensing shall make rules
governing the form of the statement required under Subsection (2)(a)(ix).
