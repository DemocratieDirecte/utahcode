73-3-21.1.   Priorities between appropriators.
(1)  As used in this section, "temporary water shortage emergency" means a
shortage of water:
(a)  whether caused by drought, manmade, or naturally caused;
(b)  for which the governor has declared an emergency; and
(c)  that may not exceed in duration more than two consecutive calendar years.

emergency, the use of water for drinking, sanitation, and fire suppression has

temporary water shortage emergency if:

(C)  a public water supplier, as defined in Section 73-1-4; and
(ii)  the water is used without unnecessary waste.
(c)  Notwithstanding Subsection (2)(a), if there is a temporary water shortage
emergency, the use of water for agricultural purposes, including irrigation
and livestock water, has a preferential right over any other right, except as
provided in Subsection (2)(b).
(3)  A person using water preferentially during a temporary water shortage
emergency shall pay annually to the appropriator whose water use is
interrupted the reasonable value of the water use interrupted, crop losses,
and other consequential damages incurred as a result of the interruption.
