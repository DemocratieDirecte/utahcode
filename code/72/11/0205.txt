(1)  A passenger ropeway may not be operated in this state unless it is
registered with the committee, except as provided in Subsections (2) and (3).

the operator to operate the passenger ropeway until final action on the
application is taken by the committee.

ropeway, then the operator may continue the operation of the passenger ropeway
under the existing registration until the committee takes final action on the
pending application and has:

(b)  given written notice to the operator that the passenger ropeway has not
qualified for certification.
