59-7-108.   Distributions by corporations.

(1)  For the purpose of this chapter, each distribution is made out of earnings or profits to the extent thereof, and from the most recently accumulated earnings or profits.  Any earnings or profits accumulated or increase in value of property accrued before January 1, 1931, may be excluded from taxable income after the earnings and profits accumulated after December 31, 1930 have been distributed, but any such distribution shall be applied against and reduce the basis of the stock.

(2)  If any distribution which is not in partial or complete liquidation is made by a corporation to its shareholders, is not out of increase in value of property accrued before January 1, 1931, and is not out of earnings or profits, then the amount of such distribution shall be applied against and reduce the basis of the stock.  If the distribution is in excess of such basis, the excess shall be treated as a gain from the sale or exchange of property.  The provisions of this subsection also apply to distributions from depletion reserves based on percentage depletion allowed by this chapter.
