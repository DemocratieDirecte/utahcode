-- Owner's prerogative regarding provision of animal to an institution.
The governing body of the county or municipality in which an establishment is
located shall make available to an authorized institution as many impounded
animals in that establishment as the institution may request; provided,
however, that such animals shall have been legally impounded at least five
days or for such other minimum period as may be specified by municipal
ordinance, and remain unclaimed and unredeemed by their owners or by any other
person entitled to do so.  The establishment shall first make a reasonable
effort to find the rightful owner of such animal, and if the owner is not
found, shall make a reasonable effort to make the animal available to others
during the impound period.  Owners of animals who voluntarily provide their
animals to an establishment may, by signature, determine whether or not the
animal may be provided to an institution or used for research or educational
purposes.
