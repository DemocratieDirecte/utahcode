(1) (a)  A political subdivision may contract with an applicant approved under
Section 26-8a-404 to provide 911 ambulance or paramedic services for the
geographic service area that is approved by the department in accordance with
Subsection (2), if the political subdivision complies with the provisions of
this section and Section 26-8a-405.3.
(b)  The provisions of this section and Sections 26-8a-405.1 and 26-8a-405.3
do not require a political subdivision to issue a request for proposal for
ambulance or paramedic services.  If a political subdivision does not contract
with an applicant in accordance with this section and Section 26-8a-405.3, the
provisions of Sections 26-8a-406 through 26-8a-409 apply to the issuance of a
license for ambulance or paramedic services in the geographic service area
that is within the boundaries of the political subdivision.
(c) (i)  For purposes of this Subsection (1)(c):
(A)  "Local district" means a local district under Title 17B, Limited Purpose
Local Government Entities - Local Districts, that:
(I)  is located in a county of the first or second class; and
(II)  provides fire protection, paramedic, and emergency services.
(B)  "Participating municipality" means a city or town whose area is partly or
entirely included within a county service area or local district.
(C)  "Participating county" means a county whose unincorporated area is partly
or entirely included within a local district.
(ii)  A participating municipality or participating county may contract with a
provider for 911 ambulance or paramedic service as provided in this section
and Section 26-8a-405.3.
(iii)  If the participating municipality or participating county contracts
with a provider for 911 ambulance or paramedic services under this section and
Section 26-8a-405.3:
(A)  the local district is not obligated to provide the ambulance or paramedic
services that are included in the contract between the participating
municipality or the participating county and the 911 ambulance or paramedic
provider;
(B)  the local district may impose taxes and obligations within the local
district in the same manner as if the participating municipality or
participating county were receiving all services offered by the local
district; and
(C)  the participating municipality's and participating county's obligations
to the local district are not diminished.
(2) (a)  The political subdivision shall submit the request for proposal and
the exclusive geographic service area to be included in the request for
proposal to the department for approval prior to issuing the request for
proposal.  The department shall approve the request for proposal and the
exclusive geographic service area:
(i)  unless the geographic service area creates an orphaned area; and
(ii)  in accordance with Subsections (2)(b) and (c).
(b)  The exclusive geographic service area may:
(i)  include the entire geographic service area that is within the political
subdivision's boundaries;
(ii)  include islands within or adjacent to other peripheral areas not
included in the political subdivision that governs the geographic service
area; or
(iii)  exclude portions of the geographic service area within the political
subdivision's boundaries if another political subdivision or licensed provider
agrees to include the excluded area within their license.
(c)  The proposed geographic service area for 911 ambulance or paramedic
service must demonstrate that non-911 ambulance or paramedic service will be
provided in the geographic service area, either by the current provider, the
applicant, or some other method acceptable to the department.  The department
may consider the effect of the proposed geographic service area on the costs
to the non-911 provider and that provider's ability to provide only non-911
services in the proposed area.
