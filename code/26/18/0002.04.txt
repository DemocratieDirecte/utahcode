(i)  on the preferred drug list on the date that this act takes effect; or

(ii)  added to the preferred drug list after this act takes effect; and

(e)  except as prohibited by Subsections 58-17b-606(4) and (5), the prior authorization requirements established under Subsections (1)(c) and (d) shall permit a health care provider or the health care provider's agent to obtain a prior authorization override of the preferred drug list through the department's pharmacy prior authorization review process, which shall:

(iii)  require the health care provider to provide the department with documentation of the medical need for the preferred drug list override in accordance with criteria established by the department in consultation with the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee.

(2) (a)  For purposes of this Subsection (2), "immunosuppressive drug":
