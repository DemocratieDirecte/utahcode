(3)  No association shall make any loan authorized by this section unless it first has determined that the type, amount, purpose, and repayment provisions of the loan in relation to the borrower's resources and credit standing support the reasonable belief that the loan will be financially sound and will be repaid according to its terms, and that the loan is not otherwise unlawful.

(4) (a)  An association may pay taxes, assessments, ground rents, insurance premiums, and other similar charges for the protection of its real estate loans.

(b)  All such payments shall be added to the unpaid balance of the loan and shall be equally secured by the first lien on the property as the original amounts advanced.

(c)  An association may require life insurance to be assigned as additional collateral upon any real estate loan, and if it does so require, the association shall obtain a first lien upon the policy and may advance premiums thereon, and the premium advances shall be added to the unpaid balance of the loan and shall be equally secured by the first lien on the property as the original amount advanced.

(5) (a)  An association may require, subject to the provisions of the Interest on Mortgage Loan Reserve Accounts Act, Sections 7-17-1 through 7-17-10, that a borrower pay monthly in advance, in addition to interest or interest and principal payments, the equivalent of 1/12 of the estimated annual taxes, assessments, insurance premiums, ground rents, and other charges upon the real estate securing a loan, or any of those charges, so as to enable the association to pay the charges as they become due from the funds so received.

(b)  The amount of the monthly payments may be increased or decreased to provide reasonably for the payment of the estimated annual taxes, assessments, insurance premiums, and other charges.

(c)  If the association advances its own funds for the purposes stated, that amount shall be secured by the association's mortgage or trust deed, if any, with the same priority as the original amount advanced under the mortgage or trust deed.
