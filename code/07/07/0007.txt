7-7-7.   Conversion of associations.
(1)  Any state or federal mutual association and any federal capital stock
association may convert to a state capital stock association, and any state or
federal capital stock association and any federal mutual association may
convert to a state mutual association upon an equitable basis subject to the
laws and rules governing the converting association, the approval of the
commissioner, the approval of the members or stockholders of the converting
association, and any rules adopted by the commissioner under this subsection.
(a)  Upon receipt of the approval of a proposed conversion from the
commissioner, a converting association may, under the supervision of the
supervisor, carry out the plan of conversion.  A record of all acts and
proceedings taken by the board of directors of the converting association in
carrying out the proposed conversion shall be filed with the supervisor.
(b)  Upon the issuance to an applicant of a certificate of conversion, the
corporate existence of the converting applicant shall not terminate, but the
applicant shall be a continuation of the entity so converted. All property of
the converting applicant, including its rights, titles, and interests in and
to all property of whatever kind, whether real, personal, or mixed, things in
action, and every right, privilege, interest and asset of any conceivable
value or benefit then existing, or pertaining to it, or which would inure to
it, immediately, by operation of law and without any conveyance or transfer
and without any further act or deed, shall vest in and remain the property of
the converted applicant, and the same shall have, hold, and enjoy that
property in its own right as fully and to the same extent as that property was
possessed, held, and enjoyed by the converting applicant before the
conversion, and the converted applicant, upon issuance of the certificate of
the conversion, shall continue to have and succeed to all the rights,
obligations, and relations of the converting applicant. Pending actions and
other judicial proceedings to which the converting applicant is a party shall
not be abated or discontinued by reason of the conversion, but may be
prosecuted to final judgment, order, or decree in the same manner as if
conversion had not occurred, and the converted applicant may continue the
actions in its new corporate name.  Any judgment, order, or decree may be
rendered for or against it which might have been rendered for or against the
converting applicant involved before the conversion in the proceedings.
(c)  A conversion carried out under this Subsection (1) is effective on the
date that all provisions of this chapter and the rules adopted under it have
been complied with and a certificate of conversion has been issued by the
commissioner.
(d)  In adopting rules or issuing orders in connection with the conversion of
an association, the commissioner shall ensure that:
(i)  accurate and adequate disclosure of the terms and effects of plans of
conversion are provided to purchasers of capital stock in resulting
associations, including account holders of converting mutual associations;
(ii)  adjustments are made in plans of conversion to be effected by way of
merger or holding company acquisition necessary or appropriate to accomplish
the purposes of this section;
(iii)  plans of conversion and proxy statements, offering circulars and
related instruments and actions implementing those plans are subject to review
and approval by the appropriate supervisory authorities;
(iv)  the capital stock issued as a part of conversion is fairly and
independently valued and priced;
(v)  the capital stock is allocated and distributed fairly and without
employment of manipulative or deceptive devices;
(vi)  appropriate provision is made regarding fractional share interest and
minimum capital stock purchase requirements; and
(vii)  plans of conversion are adopted and implemented in such form and manner
that stability and continuity of management are encouraged and that the
stability, safety, and soundness of associations and other financial
institutions are not impaired.  In no event shall any rule or order issued by
the commissioner regarding the conversion of an association make it more
difficult for an association subject to those rules or orders to implement
conversion than for an association subject only to federal laws and
regulations.
(e)  A conversion proposed by a domestic association shall, after approval by
the commissioner, be submitted to the members or stockholders at an annual
meeting or at a special meeting called to consider that action.  The
conversion must have the approval of a majority of the total votes eligible to
be cast by members or stockholders at the meeting. Notice shall be given of
any meeting at which a conversion is to be considered.  The notice shall
expressly state that a proposed conversion will be submitted for approval or
disapproval, include a full and accurate description of the plan of conversion
and all other matters to be brought before the meeting, state that a proxy for
the meeting given previously is revocable, and state the time, date, and place
of the meeting.  The notice shall be mailed at least 20 days prior to the date
of the meeting to each voting member or stockholder of the converting
association addressed to his address shown on the records of the association
and to the supervisor or commissioner.
(f)  If the commissioner finds that a conversion proceeding has been completed
in accordance with the requirements of this section and any other applicable
law and rules, he shall issue to the applicant a certificate of conversion,
attaching as a part of the certificate a copy of the charter, articles of
incorporation, articles of association, or similar instrument.  The
commissioner shall also cause the same to be filed with the Division of
Corporations and Commercial Code.
(2)  Any state mutual or state capital stock association eligible under
federal law or regulations to become a federal association may convert to a
federal association by following the procedure outlined in this Subsection
(2).
(a)  At any regular meeting or at any special meeting of the members or
stockholders of the association called to consider the action and held in
accordance with the laws governing the association, the members or
stockholders by majority vote of those present or voting by proxy may declare
by resolution the determination to convert the association into a federal
association.
(b)  A copy of the minutes of the meeting of the members or shareholders
verified by the affidavit of the president or vice president and the secretary
of the meeting shall be, within ten days after the meeting, filed with the
commissioner.  This verified copy of the minutes of the meeting, when so
filed, shall be presumptive evidence of the holding of the meeting and of the
action there taken by the members or stockholders.
(c)  Within a reasonable time and without any unnecessary delay after the
adjournment of the meeting of shareholders, the association shall take such
action as may be necessary under requirements of the Office of Thrift
Supervision or other federal agency to make it a federal association, and
within ten days after receipt of the federal charter there shall be filed with
the commissioner a copy of the charter or a certificate showing the
organization of the association as a federal association, certified by or on
behalf of the Office of Thrift Supervision or other federal agency.  Upon the
filing of these instruments the association shall cease to be a state
association and shall thereafter be a federal association.
(d)  Upon completion of a conversion to a federal association, the corporate
existence of the converting association shall not terminate, but the
association shall be a continuation of the entity so converted. All property
of the converting association, including its rights, titles, and interests in
and to all property of whatever kind, whether real, personal, or mixed, things
in action, and every right, privilege, interest, and asset of any conceivable
value or benefit then existing, or pertaining to it, or which would inure to
it, immediately, by operation of law and without any conveyance or transfer
and without any further act or deed, shall vest in and remain the property of
the converted association, and the same shall have, hold, and enjoy that
property in its own right as fully and to the same extent as that property was
possessed, held, and enjoyed by the converting association, and the converted
association shall continue to have and succeed to all the rights, obligations,
and relations of the converting association.  All pending actions and other
judicial proceedings to which the converting association is a party shall not
be abated or discontinued by reason of the conversion, but may be prosecuted
to final judgment, order, or decree in the same manner as if the conversion
had not been made, and the converted association may continue the actions in
its new corporate name. Any judgment, order, or decree may be rendered for or
against it which might have been rendered for or against the converting
association before the conversion involved in the proceedings.
(e)  Upon the completion of a conversion to a federal association, the
converted association shall cease to be supervised by the commissioner or by
this state except as a federal association.
