20A-4-107.   Review and disposition of provisional ballot envelopes.
(1)  As used in this section, a voter is "legally entitled to vote" if:
(a)  the voter:
(i)  is registered to vote in the state;
(ii)  resides within the voting precinct where the voter seeks to vote; and
(iii)  provided valid voter identification to the poll worker as indicated by
a notation in the official register;
(b)  the voter:
(i)  is registered to vote in the state;
(ii) (A)  provided valid voter identification to the poll worker as indicated
by a notation in the official register; or
(B)  either failed to provide valid voter identification or the documents
provided as valid voter identification were inadequate and the poll worker
recorded that fact in the official register but the county clerk verifies the
voter's identity and residence through some other means; and
(iii)  did not vote in the voter's precinct of residence, but the ballot that
the voter voted is identical to the ballot voted in the voter's precinct of
residence; or
(c)  the voter:
(i)  is registered to vote in the state;
(ii)  either failed to provide valid voter identification or the documents
provided as valid voter identification were inadequate and the poll worker
recorded that fact in the official register; and
(iii) (A)  the county clerk verifies the voter's identity and residence
through some other means as reliable as photo identification; or
(B)  the voter provides valid voter identification to the county clerk or an
election officer who is administering the election by the close of normal
office hours on Monday after the date of the election.
(2) (a)  Upon receipt of provisional ballot envelopes, the election officer
shall review the affirmation on the face of each provisional ballot envelope
and determine if the person signing the affirmation is a registered voter and
legally entitled to vote the ballot that the voter voted.
(b)  If the election officer determines that the person is not a registered
voter or is not legally entitled to vote the ballot that the voter voted, the
election officer shall retain the ballot envelope, unopened, for the period
specified in Section 20A-4-202 unless ordered by a court to produce or count
it.
(c)  If the election officer determines that the person is a registered voter
and is legally entitled to vote the ballot that the voter voted, the election
officer shall remove the ballot from the provisional ballot envelope and place
the ballot with the absentee ballots to be counted with those ballots at the
canvass.
(d)  The election officer may not count, or allow to be counted a provisional
ballot unless the voter's identity and residence is established by a
preponderance of the evidence.
(3)  If the election officer determines that the person is a registered voter,
the election officer shall ensure that the voter registration records are
updated to reflect the information provided on the provisional ballot
envelope.
(4)  If the election officer determines that the person is not a registered
voter and the information on the provisional ballot envelope is complete, the
election officer shall:
(a)  consider the provisional ballot envelope a voter registration form; and
(b)  register the voter.
