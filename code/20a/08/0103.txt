political party.

voters that is not a continuing political party shall:
(a)  circulate a petition seeking registered political party status beginning
no earlier than the date of the statewide canvass held after the last regular
general election and ending no later than the February 15 of the year in which
the next regular general election will be held; and

behalf of the organization.
(4)  The lieutenant governor shall:

distinguishable from the names and emblems of other registered political
parties, the lieutenant governor shall notify the filing officer that he has
seven days to submit a new name or emblem to the lieutenant governor.
