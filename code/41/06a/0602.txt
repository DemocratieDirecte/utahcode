(i)  the design speed;
(ii)  prevailing vehicle speeds;

density that may be appropriate for a higher speed limit when establishing a
speed limit under this Subsection (3)(c).
(iii)  If the department establishes a posted speed limit that exceeds the

impacts of increasing a speed limit under this Subsection (3)(c).
