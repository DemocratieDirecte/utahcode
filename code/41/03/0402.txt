or lease of a motor vehicle and there is an outstanding loan balance owing on
the trade-in, then the dealer, within 21 calendar days of the date of sale or
lease, or within 15 calendar days of receiving payment in full for the motor
vehicle it sold, whichever date is earlier, shall remit payment to the
lienholder sufficient to pay off the lien on the traded in motor vehicle,
unless the underlying contract of sale or lease contract has been rescinded
before expiration of the 21 days.
(2)  A lienholder who has been paid in full by a dealer in accordance with the
terms of this section shall deliver to the dealer a properly executed title

(b)  three business days after the business day on which the funds are
received when the funds are in the form of a check drawn on a local

when the funds are in the form of a check drawn on a nonlocal originating
depository institution.

Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday, then the time for performance is
extended to the immediately following business day.

dealer to recover damages proximately caused by the dealer's failure to comply
with the provisions of this section, together with costs and reasonable
