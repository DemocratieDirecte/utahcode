the state and participating counties collectively for the purpose of
asserting, defending, or litigating state and local government rights under

participating county;
(b)  allows a county to formally agree to participate in the plan by adopting
a resolution;
(c)  provides that the state and a participating county are equal partners in

governor, and the Utah Association of Counties shall present their
recommendations to the Constitutional Defense Council for a final decision
about the strategy or expenditure in question; and
(iii)  the county may pursue a strategy or make an expenditure contrary to the
final decision of the Constitutional Defense Council only if the county does
not claim resources provided to fund the plan.
(3)  The Constitutional Defense Council shall ensure that the plan contains:
(a)  provisions identifying which expenditure types require approval of the
plan committee and which expenditure types may be made without plan committee
approval;

the plan committee and members of the Constitutional Defense Council, and the
