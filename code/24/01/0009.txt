(a)  the person's asserted interest in the property;

(b)  the person's standing to contest the forfeiture; and

(c)  whether the person's allegations appear to be in good faith or to be frivolous.

(2)  The court shall set compensation for counsel in forfeiture proceedings at a level equivalent to compensation provided for counsel appointed in criminal cases.
