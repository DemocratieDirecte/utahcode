17C-1-407.   Limitations on tax increment.
(1) (a)  If the development of retail sales of goods is the primary objective
of an urban renewal project area, tax increment from the urban renewal project
area may not be paid to or used by an agency unless a finding of blight is
made under Chapter 2,  Part 3, Blight Determination in Urban Renewal Project
Areas.
(b)  Development of retail sales of goods does not disqualify an agency from
receiving tax increment.
(c)  After July 1, 2005, an agency may not be paid or use tax increment
generated from the value of property within an economic development project
area that is attributable to the development of retail sales of goods, unless
the tax increment was previously pledged to pay for bonds or other contractual
obligations of the agency.
(2) (a)  An agency may not be paid any portion of a taxing entity's taxes
resulting from an increase in the taxing entity's tax rate that occurs after
the taxing entity committee approves the project area budget unless, at the
time the taxing entity committee approves the project area budget, the taxing
entity committee approves payment of those increased taxes to the agency.
(b)  If the taxing entity committee does not approve of payment of the
increased taxes to the agency under Subsection (2)(a), the county shall
distribute to the taxing entity the taxes attributable to the tax rate
increase in the same manner as other property taxes.
(3)  Except as the taxing entity committee otherwise agrees, an agency may not
receive tax increment under an urban renewal or economic development project
area budget adopted on or after March 30, 2009:
(a)  that exceeds the percentage of tax increment or cumulative dollar amount
of tax increment specified in the project area budget; or
(b)  for more tax years than specified in the project area budget.
