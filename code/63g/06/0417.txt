63G-6-417.   Period of time for contract of supplies.
(1)  Unless otherwise provided by law, a contract for supplies or services may
be entered into for any period of time considered to be in the best interests
of the state; provided that the term of the contract and conditions of renewal
or extension, if any, are included in the solicitation and funds are available
for the first fiscal period at the time of contracting.  Payment and
performance obligations for succeeding fiscal periods shall be subject to the
availability and appropriation of funds.
(2)  Prior to the utilization of a multiyear contract, it shall be determined
in writing that estimated requirements cover the period of the contract and
are reasonably firm and continuing and that such a contract will serve the
best interests of the state by encouraging effective competition or otherwise
promoting economies in state procurement.
(3)  When funds are not appropriated or otherwise made available to support
continuation of performance in a subsequent fiscal period, the contract shall
be cancelled and the contractor shall be reimbursed for the reasonable value
of any nonrecurring costs incurred but not amortized in the price of the
supplies or services delivered under the contract.  The cost of cancellation
may be paid from any appropriations available for that purpose.
