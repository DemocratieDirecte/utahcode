63G-6-416.   Cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost contract prohibited.
(1)  Subject to the limitations of this section, any type of contract which
will promote the best interests of the state may be used; provided that the
use of a cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost contract is prohibited.  A cost-
reimbursement contract may be used only when a determination is made in
writing that such contract is likely to be less costly to the state than any
other type or that it is impracticable to obtain the supplies, services, or
construction required except under such a contract.
(2)  Except with respect to firm fixed-price contracts, no contract type shall
be used unless it has been determined in writing by the chief procurement
officer, the head of a purchasing agency, or a designee of either officer
that:
(a)  the proposed contractor's accounting system will permit timely
development of all necessary cost data in the form required by the specific
contract type contemplated; and
(b)  the proposed contractor's accounting system is adequate to allocate costs
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
