63G-6-602.   Certification of change order.
Under a construction contract, any change order which increases the contract
amount shall be subject to prior written certification that the change order
is within the determined project or contract budget.  The certification shall
be made by the fiscal officer of the entity responsible for funding the
project or the contract or other official responsible for monitoring and
reporting upon the status of the costs of the total project or contract
budget.  If the certification discloses a resulting increase in the total
project or contract budget, the procurement officer shall not execute or make
the change order unless sufficient funds are available or the scope of the
project or contract is adjusted to permit the degree of completion feasible
within the total project or contract budget as it existed prior to the change
order under consideration.  However, with respect to the validity, as to the
contractor, of any executed change order upon which the contractor has
reasonably relied, it shall be presumed that there has been compliance with
the provisions of this section.
