commission, may order a complete audit of the account by a certified public
accountant at the licensee's expense, or take other action in accordance with

district where the person resides or maintains a place of business, or where
the act or practice occurred or is about to occur, to enjoin the acts or
practices and to enforce compliance with this chapter or any rule or order
