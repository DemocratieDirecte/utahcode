76-7-305.5.   Requirements for printed materials and informational video --
Annual report of Department of Health.
(1)  In order to insure that a woman's consent to an abortion is truly an
informed consent, the Department of Health shall publish printed materials and
produce an informational video in accordance with the requirements of this
section.  The department and each local health department shall make those
materials and a viewing of the video available at no cost to any person.  The
printed material and the informational video shall be comprehensible and
contain all of the following:
(a)  geographically indexed materials informing the woman of public and
private services and agencies available to assist her, financially and
otherwise, through pregnancy, at childbirth, and while the child is dependent,
including services and supports available under Section 35A-3-308.  Those
materials shall contain a description of available adoption services,
including a comprehensive list of the names, addresses, and telephone numbers
of public and private agencies and private attorneys whose practice includes
adoption, and explanations of possible available financial aid during the
adoption process.  The information regarding adoption services shall include
the fact that private adoption is legal, and that the law permits adoptive
parents to pay the costs of prenatal care, childbirth, and neonatal care.  The
printed information and video shall present adoption as a preferred and
positive choice and alternative to abortion.  The department may, at its
option, include printed materials that describe the availability of a toll-
free 24-hour telephone number that may be called in order to obtain, orally,
the list and description of services, agencies, and adoption attorneys in the
locality of the caller;
(b)  truthful and nonmisleading descriptions of the probable anatomical and
physiological characteristics of the unborn child at two-week gestational
increments from fertilization to full term, accompanied by pictures or video
segments representing the development of an unborn child at those gestational
increments.  The descriptions shall include information about brain and heart
function and the presence of external members and internal organs during the
applicable stages of development.  Any pictures used shall contain the
dimensions of the fetus and shall be realistic and appropriate for that
woman's stage of pregnancy.  The materials shall be designed to convey
accurate scientific information about an unborn child at the various
gestational ages, and to convey the state's preference for childbirth over
abortion;
(c)  truthful, nonmisleading descriptions of abortion procedures used in
current medical practice at the various stages of growth of the unborn child,
the medical risks commonly associated with each procedure, including those
related to subsequent childbearing, the consequences of each procedure to the
fetus at various stages of fetal development, the possible detrimental
psychological effects of abortion, and the medical risks associated with
carrying a child to term;
(d)  any relevant information on the possibility of an unborn child's survival
at the two-week gestational increments described in Subsection (1)(b);
(e)  information on the availability of medical assistance benefits for
prenatal care, childbirth, and neonatal care;
(f)  a statement conveying that it is unlawful for any person to coerce a
woman to undergo an abortion;
(g)  a statement conveying that any physician who performs an abortion without
obtaining the woman's informed consent or without according her a private
medical consultation in accordance with the requirements of this section, may
be liable to her for damages in a civil action at law;
(h)  a statement conveying that the state prefers childbirth over abortion;
and
(i)  information regarding the legal responsibility of the father to assist in
child support, even in instances where he has agreed to pay for an abortion,
including a description of the services available through the Office of
Recovery Services, within the Department of Human Services, to establish and
collect that support.
(2) (a)  The printed material described in Subsection (1) shall include a
separate brochure that contains truthful, nonmisleading information regarding:
(i)  the ability of an unborn child to experience pain during an abortion
procedure;
(ii)  the measures that may be taken, including the administration of an
anesthetic or analgesic to an unborn child, to alleviate or eliminate pain to
an unborn child during an abortion procedure;
(iii)  the effectiveness and advisability of taking the measures described in
Subsection (2)(a)(ii); and
(iv)  potential medical risks to a pregnant woman that are associated with the
administration of an anesthetic or analgesic to an unborn child during an
abortion procedure.
(b)  A person or facility is not required to provide the information described
in Subsection (2)(a) to a patient or potential patient, if the abortion is to
be performed:
(i)  on an unborn child who is less than 20 weeks gestational age at the time
of the abortion; or
(ii)  on an unborn child who is at least 20 weeks gestational age at the time
of the abortion, if:
(A)  the abortion is being performed for a reason described in Subsection
76-7-302(3)(b)(i); and
(B)  due to a serious medical emergency, time does not permit compliance with
the requirement to provide the information described in Subsection (2)(a).
(3) (a)  The materials described in Subsections (1) and (2) shall be produced
and printed in a way that conveys the state's preference for childbirth over
abortion.
(b)  The printed material described in Subsections (1) and (2) shall be
printed in a typeface large enough to be clearly legible.
(4)  Except as provided in Subsection (2)(b), every facility in which
abortions are performed shall immediately provide the printed informed consent
materials and a viewing of or a copy of the informational video described in
Subsections (1) and (2) to any patient or potential patient prior to the
performance of an abortion, unless the patient's attending or referring
physician certifies in writing that he reasonably believes that provision of
the materials or video to that patient would result in a severely adverse
effect on her physical or mental health.
(5)  The Department of Health shall produce a standardized videotape that may
be used statewide, containing all of the information described in Subsection
(1), in accordance with the requirements of Subsections (1) and (3).  In
preparing the video, the department may summarize and make reference to the
printed comprehensive list of geographically indexed names and services
described in Subsection (1)(a).  The videotape shall, in addition to the
information described in Subsection (1), show an ultrasound of the heart beat
of an unborn child at three weeks gestational age, at six to eight weeks
gestational age, and each month thereafter, until 14 weeks gestational age.
That information shall be presented in a truthful, nonmisleading manner
designed to convey accurate scientific information, the state's preference for
childbirth over abortion, and the positive aspects of adoption.
(6)  The Department of Health and local health departments shall provide
ultrasounds in accordance with the provisions of Subsection 76-7-305(2)(b), at
no expense to the pregnant woman.
(7)  The Department of Health shall compile and report the following
information annually, preserving physician and patient anonymity:
(a)  the total amount of informed consent material described in Subsections
(1) and (2) that was distributed;
(b)  the number of women who obtained abortions in this state without
receiving those materials;
(c)  the number of statements signed by attending physicians certifying to the
physicians' opinion regarding adverse effects on the patient under Subsection
(4); and

women seeking abortions.
