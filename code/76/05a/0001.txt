76-5a-1.   Legislative determinations -- Purpose of chapter.
The Legislature of Utah determines that the sexual exploitation of minors is
excessively harmful to their physiological, emotional, social, and mental
development; that minors cannot intelligently and knowingly consent to sexual
exploitation; that regardless of whether it is classified as legally obscene,
material that sexually exploits minors is not protected by the First Amendment
of the United States Constitution or by the First or Fifteenth sections of
Article I of the Utah Constitution and may be prohibited; and that prohibition
of and punishment for the distribution, possession, possession with intent to
distribute, and production of materials that sexually exploit minors is
necessary and justified to eliminate the market for those materials and to
reduce the harm to the minor inherent in the perpetuation of the record of his
sexually exploitive activities.  It is the purpose of this chapter to prohibit
the production, possession, possession with intent to distribute, and
distribution of materials which sexually exploit minors, regardless of whether
the materials are classified as legally obscene.
