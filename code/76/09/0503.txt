76-9-503.   Presumption of malice -- Reading or seeing by another not necessary -- Liability of newspaper or serial publication personnel.

(1) An injurious publication is presumed to have been malicious if no justifiable motive for making it is shown.

(2)  To sustain a charge of publishing a libel, it is not essential that the words or things complained of should have been read or seen by another. It is adequate that the accused knowingly parted with the immediate custody of the libel under circumstances which exposed it to be read or seen by any other person than himself.

(3)  Each author, editor, and proprietor of any newspaper or serial publication is chargeable with the publication of any words contained in any part of a book or number or a newspaper or serial.
