76-6-405.   Theft by deception.

(1) A person commits theft if he obtains or exercises control over property of another by deception and with a purpose to deprive him thereof.

(2)  Theft by deception does not occur, however, when there is only falsity as to matters having no pecuniary significance, or puffing by statements unlikely to deceive ordinary persons in the group addressed. "Puffing" means an exaggerated commendation of wares or worth in communications addressed to the public or to a class or group.
