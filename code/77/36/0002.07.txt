77-36-2.7.   Dismissal -- Diversion prohibited -- Plea in abeyance -- Order
pending trial.
(1)  Because of the serious nature of domestic violence, the court, in
domestic violence actions:
(a)  may not dismiss any charge or delay disposition because of concurrent
divorce or other civil proceedings;
(b)  may not require proof that either party is seeking a dissolution of
marriage before instigation of criminal proceedings;
(c)  shall waive any requirement that the victim's location be disclosed other
than to the defendant's attorney, upon a showing that there is any possibility
of further violence, and order the defendant's attorney not to disclose the
victim's location to his client;
(d)  shall identify, on the docket sheets, the criminal actions arising from
acts of domestic violence;
(e)  may dismiss a charge on stipulation of the prosecutor and the victim; and
(f)  may hold a plea in abeyance, in accordance with the provisions of Chapter
2a, Pleas in Abeyance, making treatment or any other requirement for the
defendant a condition of that status.
(2)  When the court holds a plea in abeyance in accordance with Subsection
(1)(f), the case against a perpetrator of domestic violence may be dismissed
only if the perpetrator successfully completes all conditions imposed by the
court.  If the defendant fails to complete any condition imposed by the court
under Subsection (1)(f), the court may accept the defendant's plea.
(3) (a)  Because of the likelihood of repeated violence directed at those who
have been victims of domestic violence in the past, when any defendant is
charged with a crime involving domestic violence, the court may, during any
court hearing where the defendant is present, issue an order, pending trial:
(i)  enjoining the defendant from threatening to commit or committing acts of
domestic violence or abuse against the victim and any designated family or
household member;
(ii)  prohibiting the defendant from harassing, telephoning, contacting, or
otherwise communicating with the victim, directly or indirectly;
(iii)  removing and excluding the defendant from the victim's residence and
the premises of the residence;
(iv)  ordering the defendant to stay away from the residence, school, place of
employment of the victim, and the premises of any of these, or any specified
place frequented by the victim and any designated family member; and
(v)  ordering any other relief that the court considers necessary to protect
and provide for the safety of the victim and any designated family or
household member.
(b)  Violation of an order issued pursuant to this section is punishable as
follows:
(i)  if the original arrest or subsequent charge filed is a felony, an offense
under this section is a third degree felony; and
(ii)  if the original arrest or subsequent charge filed is a misdemeanor, an
offense under this section is a class A misdemeanor.
(c)  The court shall provide the victim with a certified copy of any order
issued pursuant to this section if the victim can be located with reasonable
effort.
(4)  When a court dismisses criminal charges or a prosecutor moves to dismiss
charges against a defendant accused of a domestic violence offense, the
specific reasons for dismissal shall be recorded in the court file and made a
part of the statewide domestic violence network described in Section
78B-7-113.
(5)  When the privilege of confidential communication between spouses, or the
testimonial privilege of spouses is invoked in any criminal proceeding in
which a spouse is the victim of an alleged domestic violence offense, the
victim shall be considered to be an unavailable witness under the Utah Rules
of Evidence.
(6)  The court may not approve diversion for a perpetrator of domestic
violence.
