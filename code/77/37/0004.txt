77-37-4.   Additional rights -- Children.
In addition to all rights afforded to victims and witnesses under this
chapter, child victims and witnesses shall be afforded these rights:
(1)  Children have the right to protection from physical and emotional abuse
during their involvement with the criminal justice process.
(2)  Children are not responsible for inappropriate behavior adults commit
against them and have the right not to be questioned, in any manner, nor to
have allegations made, implying this responsibility.  Those who interview
children have the responsibility to consider the interests of the child in
this regard.
(3)  Child victims and witnesses have the right to have interviews relating to
a criminal prosecution kept to a minimum.  All agencies shall coordinate
interviews and ensure that they are conducted by persons sensitive to the
needs of children.
(4)  Child victims have the right to be informed of available community
resources that might assist them and how to gain access to those resources.
Law enforcement and prosecutors have the duty to ensure that child victims are
informed of community resources, including counseling prior to the court
proceeding, and have those services available throughout the criminal justice
process.
