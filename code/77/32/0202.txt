(1)  A determination of indigency or continuing indigency of any defendant may
be made by the court at any stage of the proceedings.
(2) (a)  Any defendant claiming indigency who is charged with a crime the
penalty of which is a class A misdemeanor or felony shall file with the court
a fully complete affidavit verified by a notary or other person authorized by
law to administer an oath and file a copy of that affidavit with the
prosecuting entity.  The affidavit shall contain the factual information
required in this section and by the court.
(b)  A defendant claiming indigency who is charged with a crime the penalty of
which is less than a class A misdemeanor is not required to comply with the
requirements of Subsection (2)(a) and Subsection (4).
(3) (a)  "Indigency" means that a person:
(i)  does not have sufficient income, assets, credit, or other means to
provide for the payment of legal counsel and all other necessary expenses of
representation without depriving that person or the family of that person of
food, shelter, clothing, and other necessities; or
(ii)  has an income level at or below 150% of the United States poverty level
as defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines published by
the United States Department of Health and Human Services; and
(iii)  has not transferred or otherwise disposed of any assets since the
commission of the offense with the intent of establishing eligibility for the
appointment of counsel under this chapter.
(b)  In making a determination of indigency, the court shall consider:
(i)  the probable expense and burden of defending the case;
(ii)  the ownership of, or any interest in, any tangible or intangible
personal property or real property, or reasonable expectancy of any such
interest;
(iii)  the amounts of debts owned by the defendant or that might reasonably be
incurred by the defendant because of illness or other needs within the
defendant's family;
(iv)  number, ages, and relationships of any dependents; and
(v)  other relevant factors.
(4)  Upon making a finding of indigence, the court shall enter the findings on
the record and enter an order assigning defense counsel to represent the
defendant in the case.  The clerk of the court shall send a copy of the
affidavit and order to the prosecutor.
(5)  If the county or municipality providing the defense counsel has any
objections to or concerns with the finding of indigency and assignment of
defense counsel or the continuing of indigency status and assignment of a
public defender, it shall file notice with the court and a hearing shall be
scheduled to review the findings and give the county or municipality the
opportunity to present evidence and arguments as to the reasons the finding of
indigency should be reversed.
(6) (a)  If the trial court finds within one year after the determination of
indigency that any defendant was erroneously or improperly determined to be
indigent, the county or municipality may proceed against that defendant for
the reasonable value of the services rendered to the defendant, including all
costs paid by the county or municipality in providing the defense counsel.
(b)  Subsection (6)(a) does not affect any restitution required of the
defendant by the court pursuant to Title 77, Chapter 32a, Defense Costs.
(c)  A defendant claiming indigency has a continuing duty to inform the court
of any material changes or change in circumstances that may affect the
determination of his eligibility for indigency.
(d)  Any person who intentionally or knowingly makes a material false
statement or omits a material fact in an affidavit for indigency is guilty of
a class B misdemeanor.
