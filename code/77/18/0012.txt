(b)  the petitioner's record includes two or more convictions for any type of

(c)  the petitioner has previously obtained expungement in any jurisdiction of
a crime which would be a felony under Utah law;
(d)  the petitioner has previously obtained expungement in any jurisdiction of

years have passed since these misdemeanor convictions;
(e)  the petitioner was convicted in any jurisdiction, subsequent to the
conviction for which expungement is sought and within the time periods
provided in Subsection (2), of a crime that would be a felony, misdemeanor, or

occurred, unless the petitioner has received a pardon from the Board of
Pardons and Parole for one or more of the convictions;
(g)  a proceeding involving a crime is pending or being instituted in any
jurisdiction against the petitioner; or

pursuant to Section 77-38a-302, or by the Board of Pardons and Parole pursuant
to Section 77-27-6 on the conviction for which the person is seeking an
expungement.
(2)  A conviction may not be included for purposes of Subsection (1)(e), and a
conviction may not be considered for expungement until, after the petitioner's

all fines ordered by the court have been satisfied, at least the following
period of time has elapsed:
(a)  seven years in the case of a felony;
(b)  10 years in the case of:

(g)  15 years in the case of multiple class A misdemeanors.
(3)  A petitioner who would not be eligible to receive a certificate of
eligibility under Subsection (1)(d) or (f) may receive a certificate of
eligibility for one additional expungement if at least 15 years have elapsed
since the last of:
(a)  release from incarceration, parole, or probation relating to the most
recent conviction; and
(b)  any other conviction which would have prevented issuance of a certificate
of eligibility under Subsection (1)(e).

criminal history file is unobtainable, the division may issue a special
certificate giving discretion of eligibility to the court.
