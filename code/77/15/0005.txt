77-15-5.   Order for hearing -- Stay of other proceedings -- Examinations of
defendant -- Scope of examination and report.
(1)  When a petition is filed pursuant to Section 77-15-3 raising the issue of
the defendant's competency to stand trial or when the court raises the issue
of the defendant's competency pursuant to Section 77-15-4, the court in which
proceedings are pending shall stay all proceedings.  If the proceedings are in
a court other than the district court in which the petition is filed, the
district court shall notify that court of the filing of the petition.  The
district court in which the petition is filed shall pass upon the sufficiency
of the allegations of incompetency.  If a petition is opposed by either party,
the court shall, prior to granting or denying the petition, hold a limited
hearing solely for the purpose of determining the sufficiency of the petition.
If the court finds that the allegations of incompetency raise a bona fide
doubt as to the defendant's competency to stand trial, it shall enter an order
for a hearing on the mental condition of the person who is the subject of the
petition.
(2) (a)  After the granting of a petition and prior to a full competency
hearing, the court may order the Department of Human Services to examine the
person and to report to the court concerning the defendant's mental condition.
(b)  The defendant shall be examined by at least two mental health experts not
involved in the current treatment of the defendant.
(c)  If the issue is sufficiently raised in the petition or if it becomes
apparent that the defendant may be incompetent due to mental retardation, at
least one expert experienced in mental retardation assessment shall evaluate
the defendant.  Upon appointment of the experts, the petitioner or other party
as directed by the court shall provide information and materials to the
examiners relevant to a determination of the defendant's competency and shall
provide copies of the charging document, arrest or incident reports pertaining
to the charged offense, known criminal history information, and known prior
mental health evaluations and treatments.
(d)  The prosecuting and defense attorneys shall cooperate in providing the
relevant information and materials to the examiners, and the court may make
the necessary orders to provide the information listed in Subsection (2)(c) to
the examiners.  The court may provide in its order for a competency
examination of a defendant that custodians of mental health records pertaining
to the defendant shall provide those records to the examiners without the need
for consent of the defendant or further order of the court.
(3)  During the examination under Subsection (2), unless the court or the
executive director of the department directs otherwise, the defendant shall be
retained in the same custody or status he was in at the time the examination
was ordered.
(4)  The experts shall in the conduct of their examination and in their report
to the court consider and address, in addition to any other factors determined
to be relevant by the experts:
(a)  the defendant's present capacity to:
(i)  comprehend and appreciate the charges or allegations against him;
(ii)  disclose to counsel pertinent facts, events, and states of mind;
(iii)  comprehend and appreciate the range and nature of possible penalties,
if applicable, that may be imposed in the proceedings against him;
(iv)  engage in reasoned choice of legal strategies and options;
(v)  understand the adversary nature of the proceedings against him;
(vi)  manifest appropriate courtroom behavior; and
(vii)  testify relevantly, if applicable;
(b)  the impact of the mental disorder, or mental retardation, if any, on the
nature and quality of the defendant's relationship with counsel;
(c)  if psychoactive medication is currently being administered:
(i)  whether the medication is necessary to maintain the defendant's
competency; and
(ii)  the effect of the medication, if any, on the defendant's demeanor and
affect and ability to participate in the proceedings.
(5)  If the expert's opinion is that the defendant is incompetent to proceed,
the expert shall indicate in the report:
(a)  which of the above factors contributes to the defendant's incompetency;
(b)  the nature of the defendant's mental disorder or mental retardation and
its relationship to the factors contributing to the defendant's incompetency;
(c)  the treatment or treatments appropriate and available; and
(d)  the defendant's capacity to give informed consent to treatment to restore
competency.
(6)  The experts examining the defendant shall provide an initial report to
the court and the prosecuting and defense attorneys within 30 days of the
receipt of the court's order.  The report shall inform the court of the
examiner's opinion concerning the competency of the defendant to stand trial,
or, in the alternative, the examiner may inform the court in writing that
additional time is needed to complete the report.  If the examiner informs the
court that additional time is needed, the examiner shall have up to an
additional 30 days to provide the report to the court and counsel.  The
examiner must provide the report within 60 days from the receipt of the
court's order unless, for good cause shown, the court authorizes an additional
period of time to complete the examination and provide the report.
(7)  Any written report submitted by the experts shall:
(a)  identify the specific matters referred for evaluation;
(b)  describe the procedures, techniques, and tests used in the examination
and the purpose or purposes for each;
(c)  state the expert's clinical observations, findings, and opinions on each
issue referred for examination by the court, and indicate specifically those
issues, if any, on which the expert could not give an opinion; and
(d)  identify the sources of information used by the expert and present the
basis for the expert's clinical findings and opinions.
(8) (a)  Any statement made by the defendant in the course of any competency
examination, whether the examination is with or without the consent of the
defendant, any testimony by the expert based upon such statement, and any
other fruits of the statement may not be admitted in evidence against the
defendant in any criminal proceeding except on an issue respecting mental
condition on which the defendant has introduced evidence.  The evidence may be
admitted, however, where relevant to a determination of the defendant's
competency.
(b)  Prior to examining the defendant, examiners should specifically advise
the defendant of the limits of confidentiality as provided under Subsection
(8)(a).
(9)  When the report is received the court shall set a date for a mental
hearing which shall be held in not less than five and not more than 15 days,
unless the court enlarges the time for good cause.  Any person or organization
directed by the department to conduct the examination may be subpoenaed to
testify at the hearing.  If the experts are in conflict as to the competency
of the defendant, all experts should be called to testify at the hearing if
reasonably available.  The court may call any examiner to testify at the
hearing who is not called by the parties.  If the court calls an examiner,
counsel for the parties may cross-examine the expert.
(10)  A person shall be presumed competent unless the court, by a
preponderance of the evidence, finds the person incompetent to proceed.  The
burden of proof is upon the proponent of incompetency at the hearing.  An
adjudication of incompetency to proceed shall not operate as an adjudication
of incompetency to give informed consent for medical treatment or for any
other purpose, unless specifically set forth in the court order.
(11) (a)  If the court finds the defendant incompetent to stand trial, its
order shall contain findings addressing each of the factors in Subsections
(4)(a) and (b) of this section.  The order issued pursuant to Subsection
77-15-6(1) which the court sends to the facility where the defendant is
committed or to the person who is responsible for assessing his progress
toward competency shall be provided contemporaneously with the transportation
and commitment order of the defendant, unless exigent circumstances require
earlier commitment in which case the court shall forward the order within five
working days of the order of transportation and commitment of the defendant.
(b)  The order finding the defendant incompetent to stand trial shall be
accompanied by:
(i)  copies of the reports of the experts filed with the court pursuant to the
order of examination if not provided previously;
(ii)  copies of any of the psychiatric, psychological, or social work reports
submitted to the court relative to the mental condition of the defendant; and
(iii)  any other documents made available to the court by either the defense
or the prosecution, pertaining to the defendant's current or past mental
condition.
(12)  If the court finds it necessary to order the defendant transported prior
to the completion of findings and compilation of documents required under
Subsection (11), the transportation and commitment order delivering the
defendant to the Utah State Hospital, or other mental health facility as
directed by the executive director of the Department of Human Services or his
designee, shall indicate that the defendant's commitment is based upon a
finding of incompetency, and the mental health facility's copy of the order
shall be accompanied by the reports of any experts filed with the court
pursuant to the order of examination.  The executive director of the
Department of Human Services or his designee may refuse to accept a defendant
as a patient unless he is accompanied by a transportation and commitment order
which is accompanied by the reports.
(13)  Upon a finding of incompetency to stand trial by the court, the
prosecuting and defense attorneys shall provide information and materials
relevant to the defendant's competency to the facility where the defendant is
committed or to the person responsible for assessing his progress towards
competency.  In addition to any other materials, the prosecuting attorney
shall provide:
(a)  copies of the charging document and supporting affidavits or other
documents used in the determination of probable cause;
(b)  arrest or incident reports prepared by a law enforcement agency
pertaining to the charged offense; and
(c)  information concerning the defendant's known criminal history.
(14)  The court may make any reasonable order to insure compliance with this
section.
(15)  Failure to comply with this section shall not result in the dismissal of
criminal charges.
