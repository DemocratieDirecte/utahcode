77-27-8.   Record of hearing.
(1)  A verbatim record of proceedings before the Board of Pardons and Parole
shall be maintained by a certified shorthand reporter or suitable electronic
recording device, except when the board dispenses with a record in a
particular hearing or a portion of the proceedings.
(2)  When the hearing involves the commutation of a death sentence, a
certified shorthand reporter, in addition to mechanical means, shall record
all proceedings except when the board dispenses with a record for the purpose
of deliberations in executive session.  The compensation of the reporter shall
be determined by the board.  The reporter shall immediately file with the
board the original record and when requested shall with reasonable diligence
furnish a transcription or copy of the record upon payment of reasonable fees
as determined by the board.
(3)  When the party in interest affirms by affidavit that he is unable to pay
for a transcript or copy of the record which is necessary for further
proceedings available to him, and that affidavit is not refuted, the board may
order the reporter to furnish to the party in interest a transcript, or a copy
of the record, or so much of it as is reasonably applicable to any further
proceedings, or a copy of the recording, at the expense of the state, to the
party in interest.
