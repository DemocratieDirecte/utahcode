58-17b-605.   Drug product equivalents.
(1)  A pharmacist or pharmacy intern dispensing a prescription order for a
specific drug by brand or proprietary name may substitute a drug product
equivalent, as defined in Section 58-17b-102, for the prescribed drug only if:
(a)  the purchaser specifically requests or consents to the substitution of a
drug product equivalent;
(b)  the drug product equivalent is of the same generic type and is designated
the therapeutic equivalent in the approved drug products with therapeutic
equivalence evaluations prepared by the Center for Drug Evaluation and
Research of the Federal Food and Drug Administration;
(c)  the drug product equivalent is permitted to move in interstate commerce;
(d)  the pharmacist or pharmacy intern counsels the patient on the use and the
expected response to the prescribed drug, whether a substitute or not, and the
substitution is not otherwise prohibited by this chapter;
(e)  the prescribing practitioner has not indicated that a drug product
equivalent may not be substituted for the drug, as provided in Subsection (5);
and
(f)  the substitution is not otherwise prohibited by law.
(2) (a)  Each out-of-state mail service pharmacy dispensing a drug product
equivalent as a substitute for another drug into this state shall notify the
patient of the substitution either by telephone or in writing.
(b)  Each out-of-state mail service pharmacy shall comply with the
requirements of this chapter with respect to a drug product equivalent
substituted for another drug, including labeling and record keeping.
(3)  Pharmacists or pharmacy interns may not substitute without the
prescriber's authorization on trade name drug product prescriptions unless the
product is currently categorized in the approved drug products with
therapeutic equivalence evaluations prepared by the Center for Drug Evaluation
and Research of the Federal Food and Drug Administration as a drug product
considered to be therapeutically equivalent to another drug product.
(4)  A pharmacist or pharmacy intern who dispenses a prescription with a drug
product equivalent under this section assumes no greater liability than would
be incurred had the pharmacist or pharmacy intern dispensed the prescription
with the drug product prescribed.
(5) (a)  If, in the opinion of the prescribing practitioner, it is in the best
interest of the patient that a drug product equivalent not be substituted for
a prescribed drug, the practitioner may indicate a prohibition on substitution
either by writing "dispense as written" or signing in the appropriate space
where two lines have been preprinted on a prescription order and captioned
"dispense as written" or "substitution permitted".
(b)  If the prescription is communicated orally by the prescribing
practitioner to the pharmacist or pharmacy intern, the practitioner shall
indicate the prohibition on substitution and that indication shall be noted in
writing by the pharmacist or pharmacy intern with the name of the practitioner
and the words "orally by" and the initials of the pharmacist or pharmacy
intern written after it.
(6)  A pharmacist or pharmacy intern who substitutes a drug product equivalent
for a prescribed drug shall communicate the substitution to the purchaser.
The drug product equivalent container shall be labeled with the name of the
drug dispensed, and the pharmacist, pharmacy intern, or pharmacy technician
shall indicate on the file copy of the prescription both the name of the
prescribed drug and the name of the drug product equivalent dispensed in its
place.
(7) (a)  For purposes of Subsection (7), "substitutes" means to substitute:
(i)  a generic drug for another generic drug;
(ii)  a generic drug for a nongeneric drug;
(iii)  a nongeneric drug for another nongeneric drug; or
(iv)  a nongeneric drug for a generic drug.
(b)  A prescribing practitioner who makes a finding under Subsection (5)(a)
for a patient with a seizure disorder shall indicate a prohibition on
substitution of a drug product equivalent in the manner provided in Subsection
(5)(a) or (b).
(c)  Except as provided in Subsection (7)(d), a pharmacist or pharmacy intern
who cannot dispense the prescribed drug as written, and who needs to
substitute a drug product equivalent for the drug prescribed to the patient to
treat or prevent seizures shall notify the prescribing practitioner prior to
the substitution.
(d)  Notification under Subsection (7)(c) is not required if the drug product
equivalent is paid for in whole or in part by Medicaid.
(8)  Failure of a licensed medical practitioner to specify that no
substitution is authorized does not constitute evidence of negligence.
