entity who asserts a claim to any property seized for forfeiture under this
section;
(b)  "Drug distributing paraphernalia" means any property used or designed to

(3)  Property subject to forfeiture under this chapter may be seized by any

jurisdiction over the property.  However, seizure without process may be made
when:
(a)  the seizure is incident to an arrest or search under a search warrant or

(b)  the property subject to seizure has been the subject of a prior judgment
in favor of the state in a criminal injunction or forfeiture proceeding under
this chapter;
(c)  the peace officer has probable cause to believe that the property is
directly or indirectly dangerous to health or safety; or
(d)  the peace officer has probable cause to believe that the property has
been used or intended to be used in violation of this chapter and has probable
cause to believe the property will be damaged, intentionally diminished in
value, destroyed, concealed, or removed from the state.
(4)  Property taken or detained under this section is not repleviable but is
in custody of the law enforcement agency making the seizure, subject only to
the orders and decrees of the court or the official having jurisdiction.  When
property is seized under this chapter, the appropriate person or agency may:
(a)  place the property under seal;
(b)  remove the property to a place designated by it or the warrant under
which it was seized; or
(c)  take custody of the property and remove it to an appropriate location for
disposition in accordance with law.
(5)  All substances listed in Schedule I that are possessed, transferred,
distributed, or offered for distribution in violation of this chapter are
contraband and no property right shall exist in them.  All substances listed
in Schedule I which are seized or come into the possession of the state may be
retained for any evidentiary or investigative purpose, including sampling or
other preservation prior to disposal or destruction by the state.
(6)  All marijuana or any species of plants from which controlled substances

violation of this chapter, or of which the owners or cultivators are unknown,
or are wild growths, may be seized and retained for any evidentiary or
investigative purpose, including sampling or other preservation prior to
disposal or destruction by the state.  Failure, upon demand by the department
or its authorized agent, of any person in occupancy or in control of land or
premises upon which species of plants are growing or being stored, to produce
an appropriate license or proof that he is the holder of a license, is
authority for the seizure and forfeiture of the plants.
(7) Forfeiture proceedings shall conform with the procedures and substantive
protections of Title 24, Chapter 1, Utah Uniform Forfeiture Procedures Act.
