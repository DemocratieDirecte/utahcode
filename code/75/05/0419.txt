75-5-419.   Accounts.

Every conservator must account to the court for his administration of the trust upon his resignation or removal and at other times as the court may direct. On termination of the protected person's minority or disability, a conservator may account to the court, or he may account to the former protected person or his personal representative. Subject to appeal or vacation within the time permitted, an order, made upon notice and hearing, allowing an intermediate account of a conservator, adjudicates as to his liabilities concerning the matters considered in connection with this account, and an order, made upon notice and hearing, allowing a final account adjudicates as to all previously unsettled liabilities of the conservator to the protected person or his successors relating to the conservatorship. In connection with any account, the court may require a conservator to submit to a physical check of the estate in his control, to be made in any manner the court may specify.
