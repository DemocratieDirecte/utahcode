75-5-303.   Procedure for court appointment of a guardian of an
incapacitated person.
(1)  The incapacitated person or any person interested in the incapacitated
person's welfare may petition for a finding of incapacity and appointment of a
guardian.
(2)  Upon the filing of a petition, the court shall set a date for hearing on
the issues of incapacity; and unless the allegedly incapacitated person has
counsel of the person's own choice, it shall appoint an attorney to represent
the person in the proceeding the cost of which shall be paid by the person
alleged to be incapacitated, unless the court determines that the petition is
without merit, in which case the attorney fees and court costs shall be paid
by the person filing the petition.
(3)  The person alleged to be incapacitated may be examined by a physician
appointed by the court who shall submit a report in writing to the court and
may be interviewed by a visitor sent by the court.  The visitor also may
interview the person seeking appointment as guardian, visit the present place
of abode of the person alleged to be incapacitated and the place it is
proposed that the person will be detained or reside if the requested
appointment is made, and submit a report in writing to the court.
(4)  The person alleged to be incapacitated shall be present at the hearing in
person and see or hear all evidence bearing upon the person's condition.   If
the person seeking the guardianship requests a waiver of presence of the
person alleged to be incapacitated, the court shall order an investigation by
a court visitor, the costs of which shall be paid by the person seeking the
guardianship.  The investigation by a court visitor is not required if there
is clear and convincing evidence from a physician that the person alleged to
be incapacitated suffers from: (a) fourth stage Alzheimer's Disease; (b)
extended comatosis; or (c) profound mental retardation.  The person alleged to
be incapacitated is entitled to be represented by counsel, to present
evidence, to cross-examine witnesses, including the court-appointed physician
and the visitor, and to trial by jury.  The issue may be determined at a
closed hearing without a jury if the person alleged to be incapacitated or the
person's counsel so requests.
