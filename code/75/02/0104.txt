75-2-104.   Requirement that heir survive decedent for 120 hours.
An individual who fails to survive the decedent by 120 hours is considered to
have predeceased the decedent for purposes of homestead allowance, exempt
property, and intestate succession, and the decedent's heirs are determined
accordingly.  If it is not established by clear and convincing evidence that
an individual who would otherwise be an heir survived the decedent by 120
hours, it is considered that the individual failed to survive for the required
period.  This section is not to be applied if its application would result in
a taking of intestate estate by the state under Section 75-2-105.
