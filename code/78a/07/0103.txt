78A-7-103.   Requirements by Judicial Council for creating and certifying
justice courts.
(1)  The Judicial Council has the responsibility for promulgating and
publishing minimum requirements both for the creation of new courts and the
certification of existing courts. The council shall also review requests for
waiver of the minimum requirements and may authorize the creation of a court
by waiving compliance with minimum requirements or by allowing for an
extension of time to meet the minimum requirements.
(2)  Existing justice courts shall be recertified at the end of each four-year
term if they continue to meet the minimum requirements for the establishment
of a new court.  Any existing court which does not meet the minimum
requirements may request a review from the council, which may authorize the
recertification of the court by waiving compliance with minimum requirements
or by allowing for an extension of time to meet those requirements.
