78A-6-1203.   Youth Court -- Authorization -- Referral.
(1)  Youth Court is a diversion program which provides an alternative
disposition for cases involving juvenile offenders in which youth
participants, under the supervision of an adult coordinator, may serve in
various capacities within the courtroom, acting in the role of jurors,
lawyers, bailiffs, clerks, and judges.
(a)  Youth who appear before youth courts have been identified by law
enforcement personnel, school officials, a prosecuting attorney, or the
juvenile court as having committed acts which indicate a need for intervention
to prevent further development toward juvenile delinquency, but which appear
to be acts that can be appropriately addressed outside the juvenile court
process.
(b)  Youth Courts may only hear cases as provided for in this part.
(c)  Youth Court is a diversion program and not a court established under the
Utah Constitution, Article VIII.
(2)  Any person may refer youth to a Youth Court for minor offenses.  Once a
referral is made, the case shall be screened by an adult coordinator to
determine whether it qualifies as a Youth Court case.
(3)  Youth Courts have authority over youth:
(a)  referred for a minor offense or offenses, or who are granted permission
for referral under this part;
(b)  who, along with a parent, guardian, or legal custodian, voluntarily and
in writing, request Youth Court involvement;
(c)  who admit having committed the referred offense;
(d)  who, along with a parent, guardian, or legal custodian, waive any
privilege against self-incrimination and right to a speedy trial; and
(e)  who, along with their parent, guardian, or legal custodian, agree to
follow the Youth Court disposition of the case.
(4)  Except with permission granted under Subsection (5), Youth Courts may not
exercise authority over youth who are under the continuing jurisdiction of the
juvenile court for law violations, including any youth who may have a matter
pending which has not yet been adjudicated.  Youth Courts may, however,
exercise authority over youth who are under the continuing jurisdiction of the
juvenile court as set forth in this Subsection (4) if the offense before the
Youth Court is not a law violation, and the referring agency has notified the
juvenile court of the referral.
(5)  Youth Courts may exercise authority over youth described in Subsection
(4), and over any other offense with the permission of the juvenile court and
the prosecuting attorney in the county or district that would have
jurisdiction if the matter were referred to juvenile court.
(6)  Permission of the juvenile court may be granted by a probation officer of
the court in the district that would have jurisdiction over the offense being
referred to Youth Court.
(7)  Youth Courts may decline to accept a youth for Youth Court disposition
for any reason and may terminate a youth from Youth Court participation at any
time.
(8)  A youth or the youth's parent, guardian, or custodian may withdraw from
the Youth Court process at any time.  The Youth Court shall immediately notify
the referring source of the withdrawal.
(9)  The Youth Court may transfer a case back to the referring source for
alternative handling at any time.
(10)  Referral of a case of Youth Court may not prohibit the subsequent
referral of the case to any court.
