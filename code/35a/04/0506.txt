35A-4-506.   Special Administrative Expense Fund.
(1)  There is created in the General Fund a restricted account known as the
Special Administrative Expense Fund.
(2) (a)  All interest and penalties collected under this chapter, less refunds
made under Subsection 35A-4-306(5), shall be paid into this fund from the
clearing account of the fund at the end of each calendar month.
(b)  Any voluntary contributions tendered as a contribution to this fund and
any other moneys received for that purpose shall be paid into this fund.
(c)  The moneys shall not be expended or available for expenditure in any
manner that would permit their substitution for, or a corresponding reduction
in, federal funds that would in the absence of those moneys be available to
finance expenditures for the administration of this chapter.
(3)  Nothing in this section shall prevent those moneys from being used as a
revolving fund to cover expenditures, necessary and proper under this chapter,
for which federal funds have been duly requested but not yet received subject
to the charging of those expenditures against the funds when received.
(4)  The moneys in this fund shall be deposited, administered, and dispersed
in accordance with the directions of the Legislature.
(5)  The moneys shall be used for the payment of costs of administration that
are found not to have been properly and validly chargeable against federal
grants or other funds received for or in the Employment Security
Administration Fund, and may be used for the payment of refunds of interest
and penalties under Subsection 35A-4-306(5).  The moneys shall be available
either to satisfy the obligations incurred by the division directly or by
requesting the state treasurer to transfer the required amounts from the
Special Administrative Expense Fund to the Employment Security Administration
Fund.
(6)  The moneys in this fund are hereby specifically made available to replace
within a reasonable time any moneys received by this state under Section 302
of the Federal Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 502, as amended, that because of
any action of contingency have been lost or have been expended for purposes
other than or in amounts in excess of those necessary for the proper
administration of this chapter.
(7)  The moneys in this fund shall be continuously available to the division
for expenditure in accordance with this section and shall not lapse at any
time or be transferred to any other fund except as directed by the
Legislature.
(8)  The state treasurer shall pay all warrants drawn upon it by the division
or its duly authorized agent in accordance with such rules as the department
shall prescribe.
(9)  The state treasurer shall be liable on the state treasurer's official
bond for the faithful performance of the treasurer's duties in connection with
the special administrative expense fund provided for under this chapter.
Liability on the official bond shall exist in addition to any liability upon
any separate bond existent on the effective date of this provision or that may
be given in the future.  All sums recovered on any surety bond losses
sustained by the special administrative expense fund shall be deposited in
that fund or in the General Fund if so directed by the Legislature.
