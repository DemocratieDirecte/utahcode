(1)  It is not a violation of Subsection 13-16-4(2) if:
(a)  a difference exists at the same level of distribution between the
transfer price or sales price of motor fuel of like grade and quality and the
price charged to a person who purchases for resale, including any discount,
rebate, allowance, service, or facility granted to any person, including any
of a supplier's own marketing operations, who purchases for resale, in excess
of those provided to any other person who purchases for resale if the
difference makes only due allowance for differences in the cost of:
(i)  manufacturing;
(ii)  transportation, shipping, or other delivery method; or
(iii)  marketing or sale resulting from the method or quantity in which the
motor fuel is sold or delivered; or
(b) a difference exists in transfer price and sales price or between sales
prices at the same marketing level if the difference exists because of a good
faith effort to meet the equally low price of a competitor or if the sale is
exempt under Section 13-5-12.
(2)  It is not a violation of Subsection 13-16-4(1) if a sale below cost is:
(a)  the result of a good faith effort to meet the equally low price of a
competitor; or
