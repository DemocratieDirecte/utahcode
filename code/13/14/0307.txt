franchisor;
(b)  the franchisee's cost of new and undamaged motor vehicles in the
franchisee's inventory of demonstrator vehicles, reduced by 1% for each 1000
miles registered on the demonstrator vehicle's odometer, except recreational
vehicles whose cost shall be reduced by 2% for each 1,000 miles registered on

nonself-propelled recreational vehicles shall be reduced by 10% of the
franchisee's vehicle cost:
(i)  plus any charges made by the franchisor for distribution, delivery, or
taxes;
(ii)  plus the franchisee's cost of any accessories added on the vehicles,
except only those recreational vehicle accessories that are listed in the
