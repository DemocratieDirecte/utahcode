(1)  Each franchisor shall specify in writing to each of its franchisees
licensed as a new motor vehicle dealer in this state:
(a)  the franchisee's obligations for new motor vehicle preparation, delivery,
and warranty service on its products;
(b)  the schedule of compensation to be paid to the franchisee for parts,
work, and service; and
(c)  the time allowance for the performance of work and service.
(2) (a)  The schedule of compensation described in Subsection (1) shall
include reasonable compensation for diagnostic work, as well as repair
service, parts, and labor.
(b)  Time allowances described in Subsection (1) for the diagnosis and
performance of warranty work and service shall be reasonable and adequate for
the work to be performed.
(3) (a)  In the determination of what constitutes reasonable compensation
under this section, the principal factor to be considered is the prevailing
wage rates being paid by franchisees in the relevant market area in which the
franchisee is doing business.
(b)  Compensation of the franchisee for warranty service work may not be less
than the amount charged by the franchisee for like parts and service to retail
or fleet customers, if the amounts are reasonable.  In the case of a
recreational vehicle franchisee, reimbursement for parts used in the
performance of warranty repairs, including those parts separately warranted
directly to the consumer by a recreational vehicle parts supplier, may not be
less than the franchisee's cost plus 20%.  For purposes of this Subsection

franchisor or supplier for the part when the part is purchased for a
nonwarranty repair.
(4)  A franchisor may not fail to:
(a)  perform any warranty obligation;
(b)  include in written notices of franchisor's recalls to new motor vehicle
owners and franchisees the expected date by which necessary parts and
equipment will be available to franchisees for the correction of the defects;
or
(c)  compensate any of the franchisees for repairs effected by the recall.
(5)  If a franchisor disallows a franchisee's claim for a defective part,
alleging that the part is not defective, the franchisor at its option shall:
(a)  return the part to the franchisee at the franchisor's expense; or
(b)  pay the franchisee the cost of the part.
(6) (a)  A claim made by a franchisee pursuant to this section for labor and
parts shall be paid within 30 days after its approval.
(b)  A claim shall be either approved or disapproved by the franchisor within
30 days after receipt of the claim on a form generally used by the franchisor
and containing the generally required information.  Any claim not specifically
disapproved of in writing within 30 days after the receipt of the form is
considered to be approved and payment shall be made within 30 days.
(7)  Warranty service audits of franchisee records may be conducted by the
franchisor on a reasonable basis.
(8)  A franchisee's claim for warranty compensation may not be denied except
for good cause such as performance of nonwarranty repairs, lack of material
documentation, fraud, or misrepresentation.
(9) (a)  Any charge backs for warranty parts or service compensation and
service incentives shall only be enforceable for the 12-month period
immediately following the date the payment for warranty reimbursement was made
by the franchisor.
(b)  Except as provided in Subsection (9)(c), all charge backs levied by a
franchisor for sales compensation or sales incentives arising out of the sale
or lease of a motor vehicle sold or leased by a franchisee shall be
compensable only if written notice of the charge back is received by the
franchisee within 12 months immediately following the sooner of:
(i)  the date when the sales incentive program terminates; or
(ii)  the date when payment for the sales compensation or sales incentive was
made by the franchisor to the franchisee.
(c)  The time limitations of this Subsection (9) do not preclude charge backs
for any fraudulent claim that was previously paid.
