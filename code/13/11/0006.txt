13-11-6.   Service of process.
In addition to any other method provided by rule or statute, personal
jurisdiction over a supplier may be acquired in a civil action or proceeding
instituted in the district court by the service of process in the following
manner.  If a supplier engages in any act or practice in this state governed
by this act, or engages in a consumer transaction subject to this act, he may
designate an agent upon whom service of process may be made in this state.
The agent shall be a resident of or a corporation authorized to do business in
this state.  The designation shall be in writing and filed with the Division
of Corporations and Commercial Code.  If no designation is made and filed, or
if process cannot be served in this state upon the designated agent, whether
or not the supplier is a resident of this state or is authorized to do
business in this state, process may be served upon the director of the
Division of Corporations and Commercial Code, but service upon him is not
effective unless the plaintiff promptly mails a copy of the process and
pleadings by registered or certified mail to the defendant at his last
reasonably ascertainable address.  An affidavit of compliance with this
section shall be filed with the clerk of the court on or before the return day
of the process, if any, or within any future time the court allows.
