54-8a-5.   Marking of underground facilities.
(1) (a)  Within 48 hours of the receipt of the notice required by Section
54-8a-4, the operator shall:
(i)  mark the location of its underground facilities in the area of the
proposed excavation; or
(ii)  notify the excavator, by telephonic or electronic message or indication
at the excavation site, that the operator does not have any underground
facility in the area of the proposed excavation.
(b)  The underground facility shall be marked with stakes, paint, or in some
other customary way, indicating, at the option of the operator, either:
(i)  the approximate centerline of the underground facility; or
(ii)  the approximate outside dimensions of both sides of the underground
facility.
(2) (a)  The operator is not required to mark the underground facilities
within 48 hours if:
(i)  the proposed excavation:
(A)  is not identified in accordance with Subsection 54-8a-4(2) or is not
marked as provided in Subsection 54-8a-4(3);
(B)  is located in a remote area;
(C)  is an extensive excavation; or
(D)  presents other constraints that make it unreasonably difficult for the
operator to comply with the marking requirements of this section; or
(ii)  the operator is not able to readily locate the underground facilities
from the surface with standard underground detection devices.
(b)  If the operator cannot proceed with the marking because of a situation
described in Subsection (2)(a), the operator shall contact the excavator
within 48 hours after the excavator's notice of excavation or request for a
location request assignment made in accordance with Section 54-8a-4 and
request a meeting at the proposed excavation site or some other mutually
agreed upon location.
(c)  For a situation described under Subsection (2)(a)(i), the meeting
constitutes the beginning of a new 48-hour period within which the operator
must begin marking the underground facilities.
(d) (i)  For the situation described under Subsection (2)(a)(ii), the
excavator and operator shall agree on a plan of excavation designed to prevent
damage to the operator's underground facility.
(ii)  Notwithstanding the agreement, the excavator shall proceed in a manner
that is reasonably calculated to avoid damage to the underground facility.
(e) (i)  An operator need not mark or locate an underground facility the
operator does not own.
(ii)  An underground facility under Subsection (2)(e)(i) includes a water or
sewer lateral or a facility running from a house to a garage or outbuilding.
(f) (i)  An operator may mark the location of a known facility connected to
the operator's facilities that is not owned or operated by the operator.
(ii)  Marking a known facility under Subsection (2)(f)(i) imposes no liability
on the operator for the accuracy of the marking.
(3)  The markings required by this section shall conform with marking
standards established by the American Public Works Association for temporary
markings.
(4)  Each marking is valid for not more than 14 calendar days from the date
notice is given.
(5)  If multiple lines exist:
(a)  the markings must indicate the number of lines; or
(b)  all lines must be marked.
