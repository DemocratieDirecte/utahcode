provisions of this title or with the orders of the commission, or that it will

any act or omission to act, or of anything accomplished or proposed, or of any
schedule, classification, rate, price, charge, fare, toll, rental, rule,
regulation, service or facility of any public utility, it shall investigate

shall be made, and upon such hearing shall make such findings and orders as
shall be just and reasonable with respect to any such matter.
