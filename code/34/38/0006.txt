34-38-6.   Requirements for collection and testing.
All sample collection and testing for drugs and alcohol under this chapter
shall be performed in accordance with the following conditions:
(1)  the collection of samples shall be performed under reasonable and
sanitary conditions;
(2)  samples shall be collected and tested with due regard to the privacy of
the individual being tested, and in a manner reasonably calculated to prevent
substitutions or interference with the collection or testing of reliable
samples;
(3)  sample collection shall be documented, and the documentation procedures
shall include:
(a)  labeling of samples so as reasonably to preclude the probability of
erroneous identification of test results; and
(b)  an opportunity for the employee or prospective employee to provide
notification of any information which he considers relevant to the test,
including identification of currently or recently used prescription or
nonprescription drugs, or other relevant medical information.
(4)  sample collection, storage, and transportation to the place of testing
shall be performed so as reasonably to preclude the probability of sample
contamination or adulteration; and
(5)  sample testing shall conform to scientifically accepted analytical
methods and procedures.  Testing shall include verification or confirmation of
any positive test result by gas chromatography, gas chromatography-mass
spectroscopy, or other comparably reliable analytical method, before the
result of any test may be used as a basis for any action by an employer under
Section 34-38-8.
