34-38-1.   Legislative findings -- Purpose and intent of chapter.
The Legislature finds that a healthy and productive work force, safe working
conditions free from the effects of drugs and alcohol, and maintenance of the
quality of products produced and services rendered in this state, are
important to employers, employees, and the general public.  The Legislature
further finds that the abuse of drugs and alcohol creates a variety of
workplace problems, including increased injuries on the job, increased
absenteeism, increased financial burden on health and benefit programs,
increased workplace theft, decreased employee morale, decreased productivity,
and a decline in the quality of products and services.
Therefore, in balancing the interests of employers, employees, and the welfare
of the general public, the Legislature finds that fair and equitable testing
for drugs and alcohol in the workplace, in accordance with this chapter, is in
the best interest of all parties.
The Legislature does not intend to prohibit any employee from seeking damages
or job reinstatement, if action was taken by his employer based on a false
drug or alcohol test result.
