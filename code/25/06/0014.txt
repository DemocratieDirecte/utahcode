(1) (a)  For trusts created on or after December 31, 2003, a settlor who in
writing irrevocably transfers property in trust to a trust having as trustee a
company defined in Subsection 7-5-1(1)(d) who holds some or all of the trust
assets in this state in a savings account described in Subsection 7-1-103(29),
a certificate of deposit, a brokerage account, a trust company fiduciary
account, or account or deposit located in this state that is similar to such
an account may provide that the income or principal interest of the settlor as
beneficiary of the trust may not be either voluntarily or involuntarily
transferred before payment or delivery to the settlor as beneficiary by the
trustee.  The provision shall be considered to be a restriction on the
transfer of the settlor's beneficial interest in the trust that is enforceable
under applicable nonbankruptcy law within the meaning of Section 541(c)(2) of
the Bankruptcy Code or successor provision.
(b)  This Subsection (1) applies to:

(C)  real property; or
(D)  interests in real property.
(2) (a)  Except as provided in Subsection (2)(c), if a trust has a restriction
as provided in Subsection (1)(a), a creditor or other claimant of the settlor
may not satisfy a claim, or liability on it, in either law or equity, out of
the settlor's transfer or settlor's beneficial interest in the trust.
(b)  For the purposes of Subsection (2)(a), a creditor includes one holding or
seeking to enforce a judgment entered by a court or other body having
adjudicative authority as well as one with a right to payment, whether or not
reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured,
unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured, or unsecured.
(c)  A restriction provided under Subsection (1) does not prevent a creditor
or person described in Subsection (2)(a) from satisfying a claim or liability
out of the settlor's beneficial interest in or transfer into trust if:
(i)  the claim is a judgment, order, decree, or other legally enforceable
decision or ruling resulting from a judicial, arbitration, mediation, or
administrative proceeding commenced prior to or within three years after the
trust is created;
(ii)  the settlor's transfer into trust is made with actual intent to hinder,
delay, or defraud that creditor;
(iii)  the trust provides that the settlor may revoke or terminate all or part
of the trust without the consent of a person who has a substantial beneficial
interest in the trust and the interest would be adversely affected by the
exercise of the settlor's power to revoke or terminate all or part of the
trust;
(iv)  the trust requires that all or a part of the trust's income or
principal, or both must be distributed to the settlor as beneficiary;
(v)  the claim is for a payment owed by a settlor under a child support
judgment or order;
(vi)  the transfer is made when the settlor is insolvent or the transfer
renders the settlor insolvent;
(vii)  the claim is for recovery of public assistance received by the settlor
allowed under Title 26, Chapter 19, Medical Benefits Recovery Act;
(viii)  the claim is a tax or other amount owed by the settlor to any
governmental entity;
(ix)  the claim is by a spouse or former spouse of the settlor on account of
an agreement or order for the payment of support or alimony or for a division
or distribution of property;
(x) (A)  the settlor transferred assets into the trust that:
(I)  were listed in a written representation of the settlor's assets given to
a claimant to induce the claimant to enter into a transaction or agreement
with the settlor; or
(II)  were transferred from the settlor's control in breach of any written
agreement, covenant, or security interest between the settlor and the
claimant; or
(B)  without limiting the claimant's right to pursue assets not held by the
trust, a claimant described in Subsection (2)(c)(x)(A) may only foreclose or
execute upon an asset in the trust listed in the written representation
described in Subsection (2)(c)(x)(A)(I) or transferred in breach of a written
agreement, covenant, or security interest as provided in Subsection
(2)(c)(x)(A)(II) to the extent of the settlor's interest in that asset when it
was transferred to the trust or the equivalent value of that asset at the time
of foreclosure or execution if the original asset was sold or traded by the
trust; or
(xi)  the claim is a judgment, award, order, sentence, fine, penalty, or other
determination of liability of the settlor for conduct of the settlor
constituting fraud, intentional infliction of harm, or a crime.
(d)  The statute of limitations for actions to satisfy a claim or liability
out of the settlor's beneficial interest in or transfer into trust under
Subsections (2)(c)(ii), (v), (vii), (viii), (ix), (x), and (xi) is the statute
of limitations applicable to the underlying action.

(3)  The satisfaction of a claim under Subsection (2)(c) is limited to that
part of the trust or transfer to which it applies.
(4) (a)  If a trust has a restriction as provided under Subsection (1), the
restriction prevents anyone, including a person listed in Subsection (2)(a),
from asserting any cause of action or claim for relief against a trustee or
anyone involved in the counseling, drafting, preparation, execution, or
funding of the trust for:
(i)  conspiracy to commit a fraudulent conveyance;

trust or property transfer is voided or set aside; and

(9)  If a trust or a property transfer to a trust is voided or set aside under
Subsection (2)(c) and the court is satisfied that the trustee did not act in
bad faith in accepting or administering the property that is the subject of
the trust:
(a)  the trustee has a first and paramount lien against the property that is
the subject of the trust in an amount equal to the entire cost properly
incurred by the trustee in a defense of the action or proceedings to void or
set aside the trust or the property transfer, including attorney fees;
(b)  the trust or property transfer that is voided or set aside is subject to
the proper fees, costs, preexisting rights, claims, and interest of the
trustee and any predecessor trustee if the trustee and predecessor trustee did
not act in bad faith; and
(c)  any beneficiary, including the settlor, may retain a distribution made by
exercising a trust power or discretion vested in the trustee of the trust, if
