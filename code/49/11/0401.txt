another upon terms and conditions established by the board.

(2)  Transfer of employment from a position covered by one system to a
position covered by another system does not cause the employee to lose active
member status.

the eligibility requirements for membership in a system or the Utah Governors'
and Legislators' Retirement Plan shall receive service credit for the term of
the employment provided that all required contributions are paid to the
office.

based upon the same period of employment as has been the basis for any

be accumulated and counted as service.  In any event, all of the service
rendered in any one fiscal or calendar year may not count for more than one
year.

determined by the participating employer.
