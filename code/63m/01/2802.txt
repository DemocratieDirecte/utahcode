63M-1-2802.   Findings.
        (1)  The Legislature finds that:
(a)  to foster and develop the renewable energy industry in Utah, including
generation and manufacturing, will promote the interest of Utah's citizens in
encouraging the growth of the state's economy;
(b)  Utah loses prospective high paying jobs, new economic growth, and
corresponding incremental new state and local revenues to competing states due
to a wide variety of competing renewable energy incentives offered by those
states; and
(c)  renewable energy initiatives and interests of state and local officials
should be aligned and united in renewable energy generation and related
manufacturing.
(2)  This part is enacted to:
(a)  increase generation of renewable energy and create high paying jobs in
the renewable energy industry, thereby growing the state's economy and
corresponding state and local revenues by providing tax credits to attract new
renewable energy projects and assist in the expansion of existing renewable
energy projects located within renewable energy development zones in the
state; and
(b)  provide a cooperative and unified working relationship between state and
local renewable energy development efforts.
