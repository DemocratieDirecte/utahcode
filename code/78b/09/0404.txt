factual innocence.
(1) (a)  In any hearing conducted under this part, the Utah attorney general
shall represent the state.
(b)  The burden is upon the petitioner to establish the petitioner's factual
innocence by clear and convincing evidence.
(2)  The court may consider:
(a)  evidence that was suppressed or would be suppressed at a criminal trial;
and
(b)  hearsay evidence, and may consider that the evidence is hearsay in
evaluating its weight and credibility.
(3)  In making its determination the court shall consider, in addition to the
evidence presented at the hearing under this part, all the evidence presented
at the original trial and at any postconviction proceedings in the case.
(4)  If the court, after considering all the evidence, determines by clear and
convincing evidence that the petitioner:
(a)  is factually innocent of one or more offenses of which the petitioner was
convicted, the court shall order that those convictions:
(i)  be vacated with prejudice; and
(ii)  be expunged from the petitioner's record; or
(b)  did not commit one or more offenses of which the petitioner was
convicted, but the court does not find by clear and convincing evidence that
the petitioner did not commit any lesser included offenses relating to those
offenses, the court shall modify the original conviction and sentence of the
petitioner as appropriate for the lesser included offense, whether or not the
lesser included offense was originally submitted to the trier of fact.
(5) (a)  If the court, after considering all the evidence, does not determine
by clear and convincing evidence that the petitioner is factually innocent of
the offense or offenses the petitioner is challenging and does not find that
Subsection (4)(b) applies, the court shall deny the petition regarding the
offense or offenses.
(b)  If the court finds that the petition was brought in bad faith, it shall
enter the finding on the record, and the petitioner may not file a second or
successive petition under this section without first applying to and obtaining
permission from the court which denied the prior petition.
