adoption.
(1)  Except as provided in Subsection (2), a final decree of adoption may not
be entered until the child has lived in the home of the adoptive parent or
parents for six months, unless, based on a finding of good cause, the court
orders that the final decree of adoption may be entered at an earlier time.
(2)  If the adoptive parent is the spouse of the birth parent, a final decree
of adoption may not be entered until the child has lived in the home of that

court orders that the final decree of adoption may be entered at an earlier
time.
(3)  If the child dies during the time that the child is placed in the home of
an adoptive parent or parents for the purpose of adoption, the court has
authority to enter a final decree of adoption after the child's death upon the
request of the adoptive parents.
(4)  The court may enter a final decree of adoption declaring that a child is
adopted by both a deceased and a surviving adoptive parent if, after the child

(b)  the surviving adoptive parent requests that the court enter the decree;
and
(c)  the decree is entered after the child has lived in the home of the
surviving adoptive parent for at least six months.
(5)  Upon request of a surviving birth parent, or a surviving parent for whom
adoption of a child has been finalized, the court may enter a final decree of
adoption declaring that a child is adopted by a deceased adoptive parent who
was the spouse of the surviving parent at the time of the adoptive parent's
death.
(6)  The court may enter a final decree of adoption declaring that a child is
adopted by both deceased adoptive parents if:
(a)  both of the adoptive parents die after the child is placed in the
adoptive parent's home; and
(b)  it is in the best interests of the child to enter the decree.
(7)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to grant any rights to the
pre-existing parents of a child to assert any interest in the child during the
six-month or one-year periods described in this section.
