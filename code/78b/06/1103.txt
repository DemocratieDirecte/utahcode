78B-6-1103.   Manufacturing facility in operation over three years -- Limited application of restrictions.

(1)  Notwithstanding Sections 76-10-803 and 78B-6-1101, a manufacturing facility or operation may not be or become a nuisance, private or public, by virtue of any changed conditions in and about its location after it has been in operation for more than three years if the manufacturing facility or operation was not a nuisance at the time it began operation.  The manufacturing facility may not increase the condition asserted to be a nuisance.  The provisions of this Subsection (1) do not apply if a nuisance results from the negligent or improper operation of a manufacturing facility.

(2)  The provisions of Subsection (1) may not affect or defeat the right of any person to recover damages for any injuries or damage sustained because of any pollution of, or change in the condition of, the waters of any stream or the overflow of the lands of any person.

(3)  Any and all ordinances now or hereafter adopted by any county or municipal corporation in which such manufacturing facility is located, which makes the operation thereof a nuisance or providing for an abatement thereof as a nuisance in the circumstances set forth in this section are null and void; provided, however, that the provisions of this subsection shall not apply whenever a nuisance results from the negligent or improper operation of any such manufacturing facility.
