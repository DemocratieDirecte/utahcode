reasonable purpose.  The merchant may not be criminally or civilly liable for
having made the request.
(3)  A merchant who has reason to believe that merchandise has been wrongfully
taken by an individual and that the merchant can recover the merchandise by
taking the individual into custody and detaining the individual may, for the
purpose of attempting to recover the merchandise or for the purpose of
informing a peace officer of the circumstances of the detention, take the
individual into custody and detain the individual in a reasonable manner and
for a reasonable length of time.  Neither the merchant nor the merchant's
employee may be criminally or civilly liable for false arrest, false
imprisonment, slander, or unlawful detention or for any other type of claim or

penalty as determined by the court of not less than $100 nor more than $500,
plus court costs and reasonable attorney fees.

(6)  A parent or guardian is not liable for damages under this section if the
parent or guardian made a reasonable effort to restrain the wrongful taking
and reported it to the merchant involved or to the law enforcement agency
having primary jurisdiction once the parent or guardian knew of the minor's
unlawful act.  A report is not required under this section if the minor was
arrested or apprehended by a peace officer or by anyone acting on behalf of
the merchant involved.

precedent to a civil action authorized under Subsection (4) or (5).

shall give written notice to the person or persons from whom the penalty is
sought.  The notice shall state:

criminal prosecution under a related criminal provision."
(b)  This notice shall be boldly and conspicuously displayed, in at least the
same size type as is used in the demand, and shall be sent with the demand for
payment of the penalty described in Subsection (4) or (5).
(9)  The provision of Section 78B-8-201 requiring that compensatory or general
damages be awarded in order to award punitive damages does not prohibit an
