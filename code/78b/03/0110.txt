78B-3-110.   Defense to civil action for damages resulting from commission
of crime.
(1)  A person may not recover from the victim of a crime for personal injury
or property damage if the person:

damage occurred while the person was on the victim's property; or
(b)  committed a crime against the victim, during which the damage or injury
occurred.
(2)  The provisions of Subsection (1) do not apply if the person can prove by
clear and convincing evidence that:
(a)  his actions did not constitute a felony; and
(b)  his culpability was less than the person from whom recovery is sought.
(3)  Subsections (1) and (2) apply to any next-of-kin, heirs, or personal
representatives of the person if the person is disabled or killed.
(4)  Subsections (1), (2), and (3) do not apply if the person committing or
attempting to commit the crime has clearly retreated from the criminal
activity.
(5)  "Clearly retreated" means that the person committing the criminal act has
fully, clearly, and immediately ceased all hostile, threatening, violent, or
criminal behavior or activity.
