11-39-107.   Procurement code.

(1)  This chapter may not be construed to:

(a)  prohibit a county legislative body from adopting the procedures of the procurement code; or

(b)  limit the application of the procurement code to a local district or special service district.

(2) (a)  In seeking bids and awarding a contract for a building improvement or public works project, a county legislative body may elect to follow the provisions of the procurement code, as the county legislative body considers appropriate under the circumstances, for specification preparation, source selection, or contract formation.

(b)  A county legislative body's election to adopt the procedures of the procurement code may not excuse the county from complying with the requirements to award a contract for work in excess of the bid limit and to publish notice of the intent to award.

(c)  An election under Subsection (2)(a) may be made on a case-by-case basis, unless the county has previously adopted the procurement code as permitted by Subsection 63G-6-104(3)(e).

(d)  The county legislative body shall:

(i)  make each election under Subsection (2)(a) in an open meeting; and

(ii)  specify in its action the portions of the procurement code to be followed.

(3)  If the estimated cost of the building improvement or public works project proposed by a local district or special service district exceeds the bid limit, the governing body of the local district or special service district may, if it determines to proceed with the building improvement or public works project, use the competitive procurement procedures of the procurement code in place of the comparable provisions of this chapter.
