11-30-7.   Pleadings -- Questions of law and fact -- Judgment.
Any defendant may file, amend, or supplement any pleading to the proceeding at
any time on or before the hearing, but not thereafter without permission of
the court.  At the time and place designated in the order, the court shall
proceed to hear and determine all questions of law and fact, and shall make
those orders which will best enable the court properly to try and determine
all questions of law and fact and to enter a judgment with the least possible
delay.  The judgment shall be based upon a written opinion of the court which
shall make findings of fact and shall state separately the court's conclusions
of law.  To the extent possible and practicable under the circumstances,
judgment shall be rendered within ten days after the hearing is concluded.
