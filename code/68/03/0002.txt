68-3-2.   Statutes in derogation of common law liberally construed -- Rules
of equity prevail.
The rule of the common law that statutes in derogation thereof are to be
strictly construed has no application to the statutes of this state. The
statutes establish the laws of this state respecting the subjects to which
they relate, and their provisions and all proceedings under them are to be
liberally construed with a view to effect the objects of the statutes and to
promote justice. Whenever there is any variance between the rules of equity
and the rules of common law in reference to the same matter the rules of
equity shall prevail.
