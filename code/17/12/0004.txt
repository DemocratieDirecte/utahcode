17-12-4.   Bond issue for auditoriums, etc., and "convention complex"
facilities -- Required -- Board of directors -- Use of revenues from
facilities -- Purpose of act -- Rights of bondholders.
Any county legislative body adopting proceedings authorizing the issuance of
county bonds for the purpose of acquiring, improving, extending, furnishing,
and equipping auditoriums, sports arenas, stadiums, convention centers, and
all properties and facilities ordinarily forming part of a so-called
"convention complex," or for any part or combination of the foregoing, shall
in the proceedings authorizing such bonds:
(1)  Provide for the creation of a board of directors which, so long as any of
the bonds remain outstanding either in original or refunded form, shall have
complete management and control of the facilities acquired with the proceeds
of the bonds. Such board shall have the number of members, possessing such
qualifications and selected for such terms, and shall operate pursuant to such
rules and regulations as may be provided in such proceedings. The members of
such board shall serve without compensation except for reimbursement of
expenses actually incurred in the performance of their duties. After the
appointment and organization of any board of directors, all vacancies
thereafter occurring, whether by expiration of term or otherwise, shall be
filled by majority vote of the remaining members of the board. Subject to the
provisions of such proceedings, the members of the board of directors shall
have the powers and duties ordinarily enjoyed by the directors of a private
corporation operating similar facilities.
(2)  Provide that all revenues of every nature derived from the operation of
the facilities so acquired with bond proceeds and not expended in the
reasonable and proper costs of maintaining and operating the facilities,
including the making of necessary repairs and replacements, be pledged to and
utilized for the payment of principal of and interest on the bonds and, if so
provided, the creation of a reserve for such purpose.
This act is adopted for the purpose of eliminating or reducing so far as
possible the ad valorem taxes necessary to be levied for the payment of such
bonds and for the purpose of improving the security of such bonds, and
accordingly the holders of the bonds from time to time shall have a vested and
enforceable contract right in the provisions of this act and in the provisions
of the bond proceedings adopted pursuant hereto.
