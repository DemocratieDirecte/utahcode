(1)  Within 60 days of receipt of a certified request under Subsection
10-2-105(1)(b)(i), the county legislative body shall engage the feasibility
consultant chosen under Subsection (2) to conduct a feasibility study.
(2)  The feasibility consultant shall be chosen by a majority vote of a
selection committee consisting of:
(a)  a person designated by the county legislative body;
(b)  a person designated by the sponsors of the request for a feasibility
study; and
(c)  a person designated by the governor.
(3)  The county legislative body shall require the feasibility consultant to:
(a)  complete the feasibility study and submit the written results to the
county legislative body and the contact sponsor no later than 90 days after
the feasibility consultant is engaged to conduct the study;
(b)  submit with the full written results of the feasibility study a summary
of the results no longer than one page in length; and
(c)  attend the public hearings under Subsection 10-2-108(1) and present the
feasibility study results and respond to questions from the public at those
hearings.
(4) (a)  The feasibility study shall consider:
(i)  the population and population density within the area proposed for
incorporation and the surrounding area;
(ii)  the history, geography, geology, and topography of and natural
boundaries within the area proposed to be incorporated and the surrounding
area;
(iii)  whether the proposed boundaries eliminate or create an unincorporated
island or peninsula;
(iv)  whether the proposed incorporation will hinder or prevent a future and
more logical and beneficial incorporation or a future logical and beneficial
annexation;
(v)  the fiscal impact on unincorporated areas, other municipalities, local
districts, special service districts, and other governmental entities in the
county;
(vi)  current and five-year projections of demographics and economic base in
the proposed city and surrounding area, including household size and income,
commercial and industrial development, and public facilities;
(vii)  projected growth in the proposed city and in adjacent areas during the
next five years;
(viii)  subject to Subsection (4)(c), the present and five-year projections of
the cost, including overhead, of governmental services in the proposed city;
(ix)  the present and five-year projected revenue for the proposed city;
(x)  the projected impact the incorporation will have over the following five
years on the amount of taxes that property owners within the proposed city and
in the remaining unincorporated county will pay;
(xi)  past expansion in terms of population and construction in the proposed
city and the surrounding area;
(xii)  the extension of the boundaries of other nearby municipalities during
the past 10 years, the willingness of those municipalities to annex the area
proposed for incorporation, and the probability that those municipalities
would annex territory within the area proposed for incorporation within the
next five years except for the incorporation; and
(xiii)  whether the legislative body of the county in which the area proposed
to be incorporated favors the incorporation proposal.
(b)  For purposes of Subsection (4)(a)(ix), the feasibility consultant shall
assume ad valorem property tax rates on residential property within the
proposed city at the same level at which they would have been without the
incorporation.
(c)  For purposes of Subsection (4)(a)(viii):
(i)  the feasibility consultant shall assume a level and quality of
governmental services to be provided to the proposed city in the future that
fairly and reasonably approximate the level and quality of governmental
services being provided to the proposed city at the time of the feasibility
study;
(ii)  in determining the present cost of a governmental service, the
feasibility consultant shall consider:
(A)  the amount it would cost the proposed city itself to provide the service
after incorporation;
(B)  if the county is currently providing the service to the proposed city,
the county's cost of providing the service; and
(C)  if the county is not currently providing the service to the proposed
city, the amount the proposed city can reasonably expect to pay for the
service under a contract for the service; and
(iii)  the five-year projected cost of a governmental service shall be based
on the amount calculated under Subsection (4)(c)(ii), taking into account
inflation and anticipated growth.
(5)  If the results of the feasibility study or revised feasibility study do
not meet the requirements of Subsection 10-2-109(3), the feasibility
consultant shall, as part of the feasibility study or revised feasibility
study and if requested by the sponsors of the request, make recommendations as
to how the boundaries of the proposed city may be altered so that the
requirements of Subsection 10-2-109(3) may be met.
(6) (a)  For purposes of this Subsection (6), "pending" means that the process
to incorporate an unincorporated area has been initiated by the filing of a
request for feasibility study under Section 10-2-103 but that, as of the date
this Subsection (6) becomes effective, a petition under Section 10-2-109 has
not yet been filed.
(b)  The amendments to Subsection (4) that become effective upon the effective
date of this Subsection (6):
(i)  apply to each pending proceeding proposing the incorporation of an
unincorporated area; and
(ii)  do not apply to a municipal incorporation proceeding under this part in
which a petition under Section 10-2-109 has been filed.
(c) (i)  If, in a pending incorporation proceeding, the feasibility consultant
has, as of the effective date of this Subsection (6), already completed the
feasibility study, the county legislative body shall, within 20 days after the
effective date of this Subsection (6) and except as provided in Subsection
(6)(c)(iii), engage the feasibility consultant to revise the feasibility study
to take into account the amendments to Subsection (4) that became effective on
the effective date of this Subsection (6).
(ii)  Except as provided in Subsection (6)(c)(iii), the county legislative
body shall require the feasibility consultant to complete the revised
feasibility study under Subsection (6)(c)(i) within 20 days after being
engaged to do so.
(iii)  Notwithstanding Subsections (6)(c)(i) and (ii), a county legislative
body is not required to engage the feasibility consultant to revise the
feasibility study if, within 15 days after the effective date of this
Subsection (6), the request sponsors file with the county clerk a written
withdrawal of the request signed by all the request sponsors.
(d)  All provisions of this part that set forth the incorporation process
following the completion of a feasibility study shall apply with equal force
following the completion of a revised feasibility study under this Subsection
(6), except that, if a petition under Section 10-2-109 has already been filed
based on the feasibility study that is revised under this Subsection (6):
(i)  the notice required by Section 10-2-108 for the revised feasibility study
shall include a statement informing signers of the petition of their right to
withdraw their signatures from the petition and of the process and deadline
for withdrawing a signature from the petition;
(ii)  a signer of the petition may withdraw the signer's signature by filing
with the county clerk a written withdrawal within 30 days after the final
notice under Subsection 10-2-108(2) has been given with respect to the revised
feasibility study; and
(iii)  unless withdrawn, a signature on the petition may be used toward
fulfilling the signature requirements under Subsection 10-2-109(2)(a) for a
petition based on the revised feasibility study.
