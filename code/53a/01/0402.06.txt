Performance Assessment System for Students (U-PASS) with each other.
(3)  The basic knowledge, skills, and competencies identified pursuant to
Subsection (2)(a) shall increase in depth and complexity from year to year and

instructional materials and methods of teaching, that are supported by
generally accepted scientific standards of evidence, that it considers most
