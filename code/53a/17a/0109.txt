53A-17a-109.   Necessarily existent small schools -- Computing additional weighted pupil units -- Consolidation of small schools.

(1)  Upon application by each school district, the State Board of Education shall, in consultation with local school boards, classify particular schools in each district as necessarily existent small schools.

(a)  Applications must be submitted to the state board before April 2, and the board must report a decision to each school district before June 2.

(b)  The state board shall adopt standards and make rules to:

(i)  govern the approval of these schools consistent with principles of efficiency and economy and which shall serve the purpose of eliminating schools where consolidation is feasible by participation in special school units; and

(ii)  ensure that districts are not building secondary schools in close proximity to one another where economy and efficiency would be better served by one school meeting the needs of secondary students in a designated geographical area.

(c)  A one or two-year secondary school that has received necessarily existent small school money under this section prior to July 1, 2000, may continue to receive such money in subsequent years under state board rule.

(2)  The state board shall prepare and publish objective standards and guidelines for determining which small schools are necessarily existent after consultation with local school boards.

(3)  The additional units for schools classified as necessarily existent small schools are computed using regression formulas adopted by the state board.

(a)  The regression formulas establish the following maximum sizes for funding under the necessarily existent small school program:

(i)  Elementary						160

(ii)  One or two-year secondary				300

(iii)  Three-year secondary					450

(iv)  Four-year secondary school				500

(v)  Six-year secondary school				600

(b)  Schools with fewer than 10 students shall receive the same add-on weighted pupil units as schools with 10 students.

(c)  The state board shall prepare and distribute an allocation table based on the regression formula to each school district.

(4) (a)  To avoid penalizing a district financially for consolidating its small schools, additional units may be allowed a district each year, not to exceed two years.

(b)  The units may not exceed the difference between what the district receives for a consolidated school and what it would have received for the small schools had they not been consolidated.

(c)  A district may use the money allocated under this subsection for maintenance and operation of school programs or for other school purposes as approved by the state board.
