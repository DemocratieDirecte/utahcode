53A-8-107.   Necessary staff reduction not precluded.

Nothing in this chapter prevents staff reduction if necessary to reduce the number of employees because of the following:

(1)  declining student enrollments in the district;

(2)  the discontinuance or substantial reduction of a particular service or program;

(3)  the shortage of anticipated revenue after the budget has been adopted; or

(4)  school consolidation.
