17B-2a-805.   Limitations on authority of a public transit district.
(1)  A public transit district may not exercise control over a transit
facility owned or operated inside or outside the district by a governmental
entity unless, upon mutually agreeable terms, the governmental entity
consents.
(2) (a)  A public transit district may not establish, directly or indirectly,
a public transit service or system, or acquire a facility necessary or
incidental to a public transit service or system, in a manner or form that
diverts, lessens, or competes for the patronage or revenue of a preexisting
system of a publicly or privately owned public carrier furnishing like
service, unless the district obtains the consent of the publicly or privately
owned carrier.
(b)  A public transit district's maintenance and operation of an existing
system that the district acquires from a publicly or privately owned public
carrier may not be considered to be the establishment of a public transit
service or system under this Subsection (2).
