67-21-3.   Reporting of governmental waste or violations of law -- Employer
action -- Exceptions.
(1) (a)  An employer may not take adverse action against an employee because
the employee, or a person authorized to act on behalf of the employee,
communicates in good faith the existence of any waste of public funds,
property, or manpower, or a violation or suspected violation of a law, rule,
or regulation adopted under the law of this state, a political subdivision of
this state, or any recognized entity of the United States.
(b)  For purposes of Subsection (1)(a), an employee is presumed to have
communicated in good faith if he gives written notice or otherwise formally
communicates the waste, violation, or reasonable suspicion to the state
auditor.  This presumption may be rebutted by showing that the employee knew
or reasonably ought to have known that the report is malicious, false, or
frivolous.
(2)  An employer may not take adverse action against an employee because an
employee participates or gives information in an investigation, hearing, court
proceeding, legislative or other inquiry, or other form of administrative
review held by the public body.
(3)  An employer may not take adverse action against an employee because the
employee has objected to or refused to carry out a directive that the employee
reasonably believes violates a law of this state, a political subdivision of
this state, or the United States, or a rule or regulation adopted under the
authority of the laws of this state, a political subdivision of this state, or
the United States.
(4)  An employer may not implement rules or policies that unreasonably
restrict an employee's ability to document the existence of any waste of
public funds, property, or manpower, or a violation or suspected violation of
any laws, rules, or regulations.
