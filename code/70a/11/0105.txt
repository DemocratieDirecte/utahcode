(1)  A financing statement or continuation statement filed prior to July 1,
1977 which shall not have lapsed prior to July 1, 1977 shall remain effective
for the period provided in the old Uniform Commercial Code, but not less than
five years after the filing.
(2)  With respect to any collateral acquired by the debtor subsequent to the
effective date of the corrected Uniform Commercial Code, any effective
financing statement or continuation statement described in this section shall
apply only if the filing or filings are in the office or offices that would be
appropriate to perfect the security interests in the new collateral under the
corrected Uniform Commercial Code.
(3)  The effectiveness of any financing statement or continuation statement
filed prior to July 1, 1977 may be continued by a continuation statement as
permitted by the corrected Uniform Commercial Code, except that if the
corrected Uniform Commercial Code requires a filing in an office where there
was no previous financing statement, a new financing statement conforming to
Section 70A-11-106 shall be filed in that office.
(4)  If the record of a mortgage of real estate would have been effective as a
fixture filing of goods described therein if the corrected Uniform Commercial
Code had been in effect on the date of recording the mortgage, the mortgage
shall be deemed effective as a fixture filing as to such goods under Section
70A-9a-502 of the corrected Uniform Commercial Code on the effective date of
the corrected Uniform Commercial Code.
