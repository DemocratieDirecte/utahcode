70A-9a-316.   Continued perfection of security interest following change in
governing law.
(1)  A security interest perfected pursuant to the law of the jurisdiction
designated in Subsection 70A-9a-301(1) or 70A-9a-305(3) remains perfected
until the earliest of:
(a)  the time perfection would have ceased under the law of that jurisdiction;
(b)  the expiration of four months after a change of the debtor's location to
another jurisdiction; or
(c)  the expiration of one year after a transfer of collateral to a person
that thereby becomes a debtor and is located in another jurisdiction.
(2)  If a security interest described in Subsection (1) becomes perfected
under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earliest time or event
described in that subsection, it remains perfected thereafter.  If the
security interest does not become perfected under the law of the other
jurisdiction before the earliest time or event, it becomes unperfected and is
deemed never to have been perfected as against a purchaser of the collateral
for value.
(3)  A possessory security interest in collateral, other than goods covered by
a certificate of title and as-extracted collateral consisting of goods,
remains continuously perfected if:
(a)  the collateral is located in one jurisdiction and subject to a security
interest perfected under the law of that jurisdiction;
(b)  thereafter the collateral is brought into another jurisdiction; and
(c)  upon entry into the other jurisdiction, the security interest is
perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction.
(4)  Except as otherwise provided in Subsection (5), a security interest in
goods covered by a certificate of title which is perfected by any method under
the law of another jurisdiction when the goods become covered by a certificate
of title from this state remains perfected until the security interest would
have become unperfected under the law of the other jurisdiction had the goods
not become so covered.
(5)  A security interest described in Subsection (4) becomes unperfected as
against a purchaser of the goods for value and is deemed never to have been
perfected as against a purchaser of the goods for value if the applicable
requirements for perfection under Subsection 70A-9a-311(2) or Section 70A-
9a-313 are not satisfied before the earlier of:
(a)  the time the security interest would have become unperfected under the
law of the other jurisdiction had the goods not become covered by a
certificate of title from this state; or
(b)  the expiration of four months after the goods had become so covered.
(6)  A security interest in deposit accounts, letter-of-credit rights, or
investment property which is perfected under the law of the bank's
jurisdiction, the issuer's jurisdiction, a nominated person's jurisdiction,
the securities intermediary's jurisdiction, or the commodity intermediary's
jurisdiction, as applicable, remains perfected until the earlier of:
(a)  the time the security interest would have become unperfected under the
law of that jurisdiction; or
(b)  the expiration of four months after a change of the applicable
jurisdiction to another jurisdiction.
(7) If a security interest described in Subsection (6) becomes perfected under
the law of the other jurisdiction before the earlier of the time or the end of
the period described in that subsection, it remains perfected thereafter.  If
the security interest does not become perfected under the law of the other
jurisdiction before the earlier of that time or the end of that period, it
becomes unperfected and is deemed never to have been perfected as against a
purchaser of the collateral for value.
