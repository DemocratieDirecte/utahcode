the use of state departments or agencies, debris or wreckage which may
threaten public health, public safety, or private property as hereinafter

pursuant to this subsection, employees of the designated state agencies are
authorized to enter upon private land or waters and perform any tasks
necessary for the removal or clearance operation;

first present an unconditional authorization for removal of such debris or
wreckage from private property and agree to indemnify the state government
against any claim arising from such removal;
(h)  recommend to the legislature additional action the governor deems
necessary to carry out the provisions of this act.
(2)  When the governor has proclaimed a "state of emergency" under this act
and when the president of the United States, at the request of the governor,
has declared an "emergency" or a "major disaster" to exist in this state, the
governor is authorized:
(a)  to enter into agreement with any agency of the United States for
temporary housing units to be occupied by disaster victims and to make such
units available to any political subdivision of this state;

utilities necessary for such temporary housing by passing through any funds
made available to the governor by an agency of the United States for this
purpose;
(c)  to temporarily suspend or modify by proclamation, during the period of
the emergency, any public health, safety, zoning, transportation or other
requirement of the law or regulation within this state if such action is
essential to provide temporary housing for disaster victims;
(d)  upon determination that a political subdivision of the state will suffer
a substantial loss of tax and other revenues because of a disaster and the
political subdivision so affected has demonstrated a need for financial
assistance to perform its governmental functions, in accordance with the
provisions of  the Utah Constitution, Article XIV, Sections 3 and 4, and
Section 10-8-6, to apply to the federal government for a loan on behalf of the
political subdivision, and to receive and disburse the proceeds to the
applicant political subdivision.  No application amount shall exceed 25% of
the annual operating budget of the applicant political subdivision for the
fiscal year in which the disaster occurs;

disaster related expenses of individuals or families adversely affected by a
disaster which cannot be sufficiently met from other means of assistance, to
apply for, accept and expend a grant by the federal government to fund such
financial assistance, subject to the terms and conditions imposed upon the
grant.

connection with an application for financial assistance under this section

$5,000 or imprisonment for not more than one year, or both.
