in-chief of military forces.
(1)  A "state of emergency" may be declared by proclamation of the governor
after a proclamation of local emergency as provided under Section 63K-4-301 if
the governor finds a disaster has occurred or the occurrence or threat of a
disaster is imminent in any area of the state in which state government
assistance is required to supplement the response and recovery efforts of the
affected political subdivision or political subdivisions.  The "state of
emergency" shall continue until the governor finds the threat or danger has
passed or the disaster reduced to the extent that emergency conditions no
longer exist.  No "state of emergency" may continue for longer than 30 days
unless extended by joint resolution of the Legislature, which may also
terminate a "state of emergency" by joint resolution at any time.  The
governor shall issue an executive order or proclamation ending the "state of
emergency" on receipt of the Legislature's resolution.  All executive orders
or proclamations issued under this subsection shall state:
(a)  the nature of the "state of emergency";
(b)  the area or areas threatened;
(c)  the conditions creating such an emergency or those conditions allowing
termination of the "state of emergency."
(2)  During the continuance of any "state of emergency" the governor is
commander-in-chief of the military forces of the state in accordance with the
provisions of Article VII, Section 4, of the Constitution of Utah, and Title
39, Chapter 1.
