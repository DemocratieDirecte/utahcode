63J-1-312.   Establishing a General Fund Budget Reserve Account -- Providing
for deposits and expenditures from the account -- Providing for interest
generated by the account.
(1)  As used in this section:
(a)  "Education Fund budget deficit" means a situation where appropriations
made by the Legislature from the Education Fund for a fiscal year exceed the
estimated revenues adopted by the Executive Appropriations Committee of the
Legislature for the Education Fund in that fiscal year.
(b)  "General Fund appropriations" means the sum of the spending authority for
a fiscal year that is:
(i)  granted by the Legislature in all appropriation acts and bills; and
(ii)  identified as coming from the General Fund.
(c)  "General Fund budget deficit" means a situation where General Fund
appropriations made by the Legislature for a fiscal year exceed the estimated
revenues adopted by the Executive Appropriations Committee of the Legislature
for the General Fund in that fiscal year.
(d)  "General Fund revenue surplus" means a situation where actual General
Fund revenues collected in a completed fiscal year exceed the estimated
revenues for the General Fund for that fiscal year that were adopted by the
Executive Appropriations Committee of the Legislature.
(e)  "Operating deficit" means that, at the end of the fiscal year, the
unreserved and undesignated fund balance in the General Fund is less than
zero.
(2)  There is created within the General Fund a restricted account to be known
as the General Fund Budget Reserve Account, which is designated to receive the
legislative appropriations, investment earnings, and the surplus revenue
required to be deposited into the account by this section.
(3) (a) (i)  Except as provided in Subsection (3)(a)(ii), at the end of any
fiscal year in which the Division of Finance, in consultation with the
Legislative Fiscal Analyst and in conjunction with the completion of the
annual audit by the state auditor, determines that there is a General Fund
revenue surplus, the Division of Finance shall transfer 25% of the General
Fund revenue surplus to the General Fund Budget Reserve Account.
(ii)  If the transfer of 25% of the General Fund revenue surplus to the
General Fund Budget Reserve Account would cause the balance in the account to
exceed 6% of General Fund appropriations for the fiscal year in which the
revenue surplus occurred, the Division of Finance shall transfer only those
funds necessary to ensure that the balance in the account equals 6% of General
Fund appropriations for the fiscal year in which the General Fund revenue
surplus occurred.
(iii)  The Division of Finance shall calculate the amount to be transferred
under this Subsection (3)(a):
(A)  before transferring from the General Fund revenue surplus any other year-
end contingency appropriations, year-end set-asides, or other year-end
transfers required by law; and
(B)  excluding the investment earnings for the fiscal year and excluding any
direct legislative appropriation made to the General Fund Budget Reserve
Account for the fiscal year.
(b) (i)  Except as provided in Subsection (3)(b)(ii), in addition to
Subsection (3)(a)(i), if a General Fund revenue surplus exists and if, within
the last 10 years, the Legislature has appropriated any money from the General
Fund Budget Reserve Account that has not been replaced by appropriation or as
provided in this Subsection (3)(b), the Division of Finance shall transfer up
to 25% more of the General Fund revenue surplus to the General Fund Budget
Reserve Account to replace the amounts appropriated, until direct legislative
appropriations, if any, and transfers from the General Fund revenue surplus
under this Subsection (3)(b) have replaced the appropriations from the
account.
(ii)  If the transfer under Subsection (3)(b)(i) would cause the balance in
the account to exceed 6% of General Fund appropriations for the fiscal year in
which the revenue surplus occurred, the Division of Finance shall transfer
only those funds necessary to ensure that the balance in the account equals 6%
of General Fund appropriations for the fiscal year in which the revenue
surplus occurred.
(iii)  The Division of Finance shall calculate the amount to be transferred
under this Subsection (3)(b):
(A)  before transferring from the General Fund revenue surplus any other year-
end contingency appropriations, year-end set-asides, or other year-end
transfers required by law; and
(B)  excluding the investment earnings for the fiscal year and excluding any
direct legislative appropriation made to the General Fund Budget Reserve
Account for the fiscal year.
(c)  For appropriations made by the Legislature to the General Fund Budget
Reserve Account, the Division of Finance shall treat those appropriations,
unless otherwise specified in the appropriation, as replacement funds for
appropriations made from the account if funds were appropriated from the
General Fund Budget Reserve Account within the past 10 years and have not yet
been replaced.
(4) (a)  If, at the close of any fiscal year, there appear to be insufficient
monies to pay additional debt service for any bonded debt authorized by the
Legislature, the Division of Finance may hold back from any General Fund
revenue surplus monies sufficient to pay the additional debt service
requirements resulting from issuance of bonded debt that was authorized by the
Legislature.
(b)  The Division of Finance may not spend the hold back amount for debt
service under Subsection (4)(a) unless and until it is appropriated by the
Legislature.
(c)  If, after calculating the amount for transfers to the General Fund Budget
Reserve Account, the remaining General Fund revenue surplus is insufficient to
cover the hold back for debt service required by Subsection (4)(a), the
Division of Finance shall reduce the transfer to the General Fund Budget
Reserve Account by the amount necessary to cover the debt service hold back.
(d)  Notwithstanding Subsection (3), the Division of Finance shall hold back
the General Fund balance for debt service authorized by this Subsection (4)
before making any transfers to the General Fund Budget Reserve Account or any
other designation or allocation of General Fund revenue surplus.
(5)  Notwithstanding Subsection (3), if, at the end of a fiscal year, the
Division of Finance determines that an operating deficit exists and that
holding back the transfers to the State Disaster Recovery Restricted Account
under Section 63J-1-314 does not eliminate the operating deficit, the Division
of Finance may reduce the transfer to the General Fund Budget Reserve Account
by the amount necessary to eliminate the operating deficit.
(6)  The Legislature may appropriate monies from the General Fund Budget
Reserve Account only to:
(a)  resolve a General Fund budget deficit, for the fiscal year in which the
General Fund budget deficit occurs;
(b)  pay some or all of state settlement agreements approved under Title 63G,
Chapter 10, State Settlement Agreements Act;
(c)  pay retroactive tax refunds; or
(d)  resolve an Education Fund budget deficit.
(7)  Interest generated from investments of money in the General Fund Budget
Reserve Account shall be deposited into the General Fund.
