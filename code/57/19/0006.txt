57-19-6.   Effective date of application.
(1)  An application for registration filed pursuant to Section 57-19-5 is
effective upon the expiration of 30 business days following its filing with
the director, unless:
(a)  an order denying the application pursuant to Section 57-19-13 is in
effect;
(b)  a prior effective date has been ordered by the director; or
(c)  the director has, prior to that date, notified the applicant of a defect
in the registration application.
(2)  An applicant may consent to the delay of effectiveness until the director
by order declares the registration to be effective.
(3)  Notwithstanding Section 57-19-4, the division may grant a temporary
permit allowing the developer to begin a sales program while the registration
is in process.  To obtain a temporary permit, the developer shall:
(a)  submit an application to the division for a temporary permit in the form
required by the division;
(b)  submit a substantially complete application for registration to the
division, including all appropriate fees and exhibits required under Section
57-19-5, plus a temporary permit fee of $100;
(c)  provide evidence acceptable to the division that all funds received by
the developer or marketing agent will be placed into an independent escrow
with instructions that funds will not be released until a final registration
has been granted;
(d)  give to each purchaser and potential purchaser a copy of the proposed
property report that the developer has submitted to the division with the
initial application; and
(e)  give to each purchaser the opportunity to cancel the purchase in
accordance with Section 57-19-12.  The purchaser shall have an additional
opportunity to cancel upon the issuance of an approved registration if the
division determines that there is a substantial difference in the disclosures
contained in the final property report and those given to the purchase in the
proposed property report.
