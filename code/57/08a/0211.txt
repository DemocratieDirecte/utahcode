(1)  As used in this section, "reserve analysis" means an analysis to
determine:
(a)  the need for a reserve fund to accumulate money to cover the cost of
repairing, replacing, and restoring common areas that have a useful life of
three years or more, but excluding any cost that can reasonably be funded from
the association's general budget or from other association funds; and
(b)  the appropriate amount of any reserve fund.
(2)  Except as otherwise provided in the governing documents, a board shall:
(a) (i)  subject to Subsection (2)(a)(ii), cause a reserve analysis to be
conducted no less frequently than every five years; and
(ii)  if no reserve analysis has been conducted since March 1, 2008, cause a
reserve analysis to be conducted before July 1, 2012; and
(b)  review and, if necessary, update a previously conducted reserve analysis
no less frequently than every two years.
(3)  The board may conduct a reserve analysis itself or may engage a reliable
person or organization, as determined by the board, to conduct the reserve
analysis.
(4) (a)  A board may not use money in a reserve fund:
(i)  for daily maintenance expenses, unless a majority of association members
vote to approve the use of reserve fund money for that purpose; or
(ii)  for any purpose other than the purpose for which the reserve fund was
established.
(b)  A board shall maintain a reserve fund separate from other association
funds.
(c)  This Subsection (4) may not be construed to limit a board from prudently
investing money in a reserve fund, subject to any investment constraints
imposed by the governing documents.
(5)  Subsections (2), (3), and (4) do not apply to an association during the
period of administrative control.
