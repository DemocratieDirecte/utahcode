(1)  As used in this section, "reserve analysis" means an analysis to determine:

(a)  the need for a reserve fund to accumulate money to cover the cost of repairing, replacing, and restoring common areas and facilities that have a useful life of three years or more, but excluding any cost that can reasonably be funded from the general budget or other funds of the association of unit owners; and

(b)  the appropriate amount of any reserve fund.

(2)  Except as otherwise provided in the declaration, a management committee shall:

(a) (i)  subject to Subsection (2)(a)(ii), cause a reserve analysis to be conducted no less frequently than every six years; and

(ii)  if no reserve analysis has been conducted since March 1, 2008, cause a reserve analysis to be conducted before July 1, 2012; and

(b)  review and, if necessary, update a previously conducted reserve analysis no less frequently than every three years.

(3)  The management committee may conduct a reserve analysis itself or may engage a reliable person or organization, as determined by the management committee, to conduct the reserve analysis.

(4) (a)  A management committee may not use money in a reserve fund:

(i)  for daily maintenance expenses, unless a majority of the members of the association of unit owners vote to approve the use of reserve fund money for that purpose; or

(ii)  for any purpose other than the purpose for which the reserve fund was established.

(b)  A management committee shall maintain a reserve fund separate from other funds of the association of unit owners.

(c)  This Subsection (4) may not be construed to limit a management committee from prudently investing money in a reserve fund, subject to any investment constraints imposed by the declaration.

(6)  An association of unit owners shall:

(a)  annually, at the annual meeting of unit owners or at a special meeting of unit owners:

(b)  prepare and keep minutes of each meeting held under Subsection (6)(a) and indicate in the minutes any decision relating to funding a reserve fund.
