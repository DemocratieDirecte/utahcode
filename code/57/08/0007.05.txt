57-8-7.5.   Reserve analysis -- Reserve fund.
(1)  As used in this section, "reserve analysis" means an analysis to
determine:
(a)  the need for a reserve fund to accumulate money to cover the cost of
repairing, replacing, and restoring common areas and facilities that have a
useful life of three years or more, but excluding any cost that can reasonably
be funded from the general budget or other funds of the association of unit
owners; and
(b)  the appropriate amount of any reserve fund.
(2)  Except as otherwise provided in the declaration, a management committee
shall:
(a) (i)  subject to Subsection (2)(a)(ii), cause a reserve analysis to be
conducted no less frequently than every five years; and
(ii)  if no reserve analysis has been conducted since March 1, 2008, cause a
reserve analysis to be conducted before July 1, 2012; and
(b)  review and, if necessary, update a previously conducted reserve analysis
no less frequently than every two years.
(3)  The management committee may conduct a reserve analysis itself or may
engage a reliable person or organization, as determined by the management
committee, to conduct the reserve analysis.
(4) (a)  A management committee may not use money in a reserve fund:
(i)  for daily maintenance expenses, unless a majority of the members of the
association of unit owners vote to approve the use of reserve fund money for
that purpose; or
(ii)  for any purpose other than the purpose for which the reserve fund was
established.
(b)  A management committee shall maintain a reserve fund separate from other
funds of the association of unit owners.
(c)  This Subsection (4) may not be construed to limit a management committee
from prudently investing money in a reserve fund, subject to any investment
constraints imposed by the declaration.
(5)  Subsections (2), (3), and (4) do not apply to an association of unit
owners during the period of declarant management.
