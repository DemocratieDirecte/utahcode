53B-13a-103.   Establishment of the Utah Centennial Opportunity Program for
Education.
(1)  The Legislature finds that the general welfare and well-being of the
state are directly related to the educational levels and skills of the
citizens of the state, and that limited financial aid for students with
demonstrated  financial need to help finance costs of attendance at Utah
public postsecondary institutions is a necessary component for ensuring access
to postsecondary education and training as the state enters its second century
of statehood.
(2)  There is created the Utah Centennial Opportunity Program for Education to
provide this limited financial assistance.
