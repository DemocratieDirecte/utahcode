30-1-32.   Master plan for counseling.
It shall be the function and duty of the premarital counseling board, after
holding public hearings, to make, adopt, and certify to the county legislative
body a master plan for premarital counseling of marriage license applicants
within the purposes and objectives of this act. The master plan shall include,
but not be limited to, counseling procedures which will make applicants aware
of problem areas in their proposed marriage and suggest ways of meeting
problems and which will induce reconsideration or postponement where the
applicants are not sufficiently matured or are not financially capable of
meeting the responsibilities of marriage or are marrying for reasons not
conducive to a sound lasting marriage. The plan shall include standards for
evaluating premarital counseling received by the applicants, prior to their
application for a marriage license, which would justify issuance of
certificate without further counseling being given or required. The board may,
from time to time, amend or extend the plan. The premarital counseling board
may appoint a staff and employees as may be necessary for its work and may
contract with social service agencies or other consultants within the county
or counties for services it requires, providing, its expenditures shall not
exceed the sums appropriated by the county legislative body plus sums placed
at its disposal through gift or otherwise.
