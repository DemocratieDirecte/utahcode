The judge of a district court may counsel either spouse or both and may in his
discretion require one or both of them to appear before him and, in those
counties where a domestic relations counselor has been appointed pursuant to
this act, require them to file a petition for conciliation and to appear
before such counselor, or may recommend the aid of a physician, psychiatrist,
psychologist, social service worker or other specialists or scientific expert,
or the pastor, bishop or presiding officer of any religious denomination to
which the parties may belong.  The power and jurisdiction granted by this act
shall be in addition to that presently exercised by the district courts and
shall not be in limitation thereof.
