30-3-10.   Custody of children in case of separation or divorce -- Custody
consideration.
(1)  If a husband and wife having minor children are separated, or their
marriage is declared void or dissolved, the court shall make an order for the
future care and custody of the minor children as it considers appropriate.
(a)  In determining any form of custody, the court shall consider the best
interests of the child and, among other factors the court finds relevant, the
following:
(i)  the past conduct and demonstrated moral standards of each of the parties;
(ii)  which parent is most likely to act in the best interest of the child,
including allowing the child frequent and continuing contact with the
noncustodial parent;
(iii)  the extent of bonding between the parent and child, meaning the depth,
quality, and nature of the relationship between a parent and child; and
(iv)  those factors outlined in Section 30-3-10.2.
(b)  The court shall, in every case, consider joint custody but may award any
form of custody which is determined to be in the best interest of the child.
(c)  The children may not be required by either party to testify unless the
trier of fact determines that extenuating circumstances exist that would
necessitate the testimony of the children be heard and there is no other
reasonable method to present their testimony.
(d)  The court may inquire of the children and take into consideration the
children's desires regarding future custody or parent-time schedules, but the
expressed desires are not controlling and the court may determine the
children's custody or parent-time otherwise.  The desires of a child 16 years
of age or older shall be given added weight, but is not the single controlling
factor.
(e)  If interviews with the children are conducted by the court pursuant to
Subsection (1)(d), they shall be conducted by the judge in camera.  The prior
consent of the parties may be obtained but is not necessary if the court finds
that an interview with the children is the only method to ascertain the
child's desires regarding custody.
(2)  In awarding custody, the court shall consider, among other factors the
court finds relevant, which parent is most likely to act in the best interests
of the child, including allowing the child frequent and continuing contact
with the noncustodial parent as the court finds appropriate.
(3)  If the court finds that one parent does not desire custody of the child,
or has attempted to permanently relinquish custody to a third party, it shall
take that evidence into consideration in determining whether to award custody
to the other parent.
(4) (a)  Except as provided in Subsection (4)(b), a court may not discriminate
against a parent due to a disability, as defined in Section 57-21-2, in
awarding custody or determining whether a substantial change has occurred for
the purpose of modifying an award of custody.
(b)  If a court takes a parent's disability into account in awarding custody
or determining whether a substantial change has occurred for the purpose of
modifying an award of custody, the parent with a disability may rebut any
evidence, presumption, or inference arising from the disability by showing
that:
(i)  the disability does not significantly or substantially inhibit the
parent's ability to provide for the physical and emotional needs of the child
at issue; or
(ii)  the parent with a disability has sufficient human, monetary, or other
resources available to supplement the parent's ability to provide for the
physical and emotional needs of the child at issue.
(c)  Nothing in this section may be construed to apply to adoption proceedings
under Title 78B, Chapter 6, Part 1, Utah Adoption Act.
(5)  This section establishes neither a preference nor a presumption for or
against joint legal custody, joint physical custody or sole custody, but
allows the court and the family the widest discretion to choose a parenting
plan that is in the best interest of the child.
